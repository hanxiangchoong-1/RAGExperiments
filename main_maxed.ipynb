[SEP] [CLS] our paid offerings for our platform are sold via subscription through resource - based pricing, and all customers and users have access to all solutions. [SEP] [CLS] in elastic cloud, our family of cloud - based offerings under which we offer our software as a hosted, managed service, we offer various subscription tiers tied to different features. [SEP] [CLS] for users who download our software, we make some of the features of our software available for free, allowing us to engage with a broad community of developers and practitioners and introduce them to the value of the elastic stack. [SEP] [CLS] we believe in the importance of an open software development model, and we develop the majority of our software in public repositories as open code under a proprietary license. [SEP] [CLS] unlike some companies, we do not build an enterprise version that is separate from our free distribution. [SEP] [CLS] we maintain a single code base across both our self - managed software and elastic - hosted services. [SEP] [CLS] all of these actions help us build a powerful commercial business model that we believe is optimized for product - led growth. [SEP] [CLS] our customers often significantly expand their usage of our products and services over time. [SEP] [CLS] expansion includes increasing the number of developers and practitioners using our products, increasing the utilization of our products for a particular use case, and utilizing our products to address new use cases. [SEP] [CLS] we focus some of our direct sales efforts on encouraging this type of expansion within our customer base, both within as well as across solutions. [SEP] [CLS] because our business model provides access to all solutions with resource - based pricing, we make it easy for customers to expand across use cases. [SEP] [CLS] our business has experienced rapid growth around the world. [SEP] [CLS] as of april 30, 2023, we had approximately 20, 200 customers compared to over 18, 600 customers and over 15, 000 customers as of april 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

      "\n",
      "According to the context:\n",
      "- \"When the company issues stock-based or cash awards to an acquired company’s shareholders, the company evaluates whether the awards are consideration or compensation for post-acquisition services.\"\n",
      "- The evaluation considers \"whether the vesting of the awards is contingent on the continued employment of the acquired company’s shareholders beyond the acquisition date.\"\n",
      "- If continued employment is required for vesting, the awards are regarded as \"compensation for post-acquisition services and recognized as expense over the requisite service period.\"\n",
      "- Acquisition-related transaction costs are \"accounted for as an operating expense in the period in which the costs are incurred.\"\n",
      "- The issuance of equity awards as consideration or compensation post-acquisition is a complex process involving evaluating vesting conditions and appropriately categorizing the awards as either part of the purchase consideration or as post-combination expenses.\n",
      "\n",
      "To provide a specific example from the context:\n",
      "- In the acquisition of CMDWatch Security Inc., \"CMD’s vested stock options were paid in cash and unvested stock options held by CMD employees were assumed by the company.\"\n",
      "- \"The fair value of the replacement equity awards associated with the pre-acquisition service period of $4.3 million, consisting of $3.0 million paid in cash to vested option holders and $1.3 million of non-cash consideration, was included in the total purchase consideration.\"\n",
      "- Additionally, \"approximately $6.6 million of the fair value of replacement equity awards was allocated to post-acquisition services that is being recognized as stock-based compensation expense over the remaining service period and was excluded from the total purchase consideration.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on my knowledge:\n",
      "- It is common practice to issue equity awards as part of the compensation package in business acquisitions. These awards often serve as both a retention tool and a component of the purchase consideration.\n",
      "- Management must assess if these awards are contingent on post-acquisition employment to determine their correct accounting treatment under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).\n",
      "\n",
