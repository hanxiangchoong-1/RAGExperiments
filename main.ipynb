[SEP] [CLS] our paid offerings for our platform are sold via subscription through resource - based pricing, and all customers and users have access to all solutions. [SEP] [CLS] in elastic cloud, our family of cloud - based offerings under which we offer our software as a hosted, managed service, we offer various subscription tiers tied to different features. [SEP] [CLS] for users who download our software, we make some of the features of our software available for free, allowing us to engage with a broad community of developers and practitioners and introduce them to the value of the elastic stack. [SEP] [CLS] we believe in the importance of an open software development model, and we develop the majority of our software in public repositories as open code under a proprietary license. [SEP] [CLS] unlike some companies, we do not build an enterprise version that is separate from our free distribution. [SEP] [CLS] we maintain a single code base across both our self - managed software and elastic - hosted services. [SEP] [CLS] all of these actions help us build a powerful commercial business model that we believe is optimized for product - led growth. [SEP] [CLS] our customers often significantly expand their usage of our products and services over time. [SEP] [CLS] expansion includes increasing the number of developers and practitioners using our products, increasing the utilization of our products for a particular use case, and utilizing our products to address new use cases. [SEP] [CLS] we focus some of our direct sales efforts on encouraging this type of expansion within our customer base, both within as well as across solutions. [SEP] [CLS] because our business model provides access to all solutions with resource - based pricing, we make it easy for customers to expand across use cases. [SEP] [CLS] our business has experienced rapid growth around the world. [SEP] [CLS] as of april 30, 2023, we had approximately 20, 200 customers compared to over 18, 600 customers and over 15, 000 customers as of april 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

      "1. **Offer to Repurchase Senior Notes**:\n",

      "2. **Limited Ability to Repurchase**:\n",

      "\n",
      "3. **Financing Concerns**:\n",
      "   - Elastic may need to arrange necessary financing to repurchase the senior notes, which might not be possible on acceptable terms, if at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Potential Defaults**:\n",
      "   - Failure to repurchase the senior notes could result in a default under the senior notes, leading to the acceleration of the senior notes and other existing indebtedness.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Foreclosure and Bankruptcy Risk**:\n",
      "   - Inability to meet the payment obligations triggered by acceleration could result in foreclosure proceedings and potentially seeking protection under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.\n",

      "\n",
      "In general, change of control clauses, such as the one outlined, are common in debt indentures to protect bondholders from significant organizational changes that may affect the creditworthiness of the issuer. Such clauses are designed to provide a remedy (i.e., the option to have their debt repurchased) for bondholders if the company undergoes a change of control, often seen as escalated risk. These steps help ensure that bondholders have a predictable exit strategy if the company's future becomes uncertain due to new ownership or significant changes in governance.\n"

      "\n",
      "2. **General Policy for Equity Awards in Acquisitions**:\n",
      "   - The company evaluates whether stock-based or cash awards to an acquired company's shareholders are consideration for the acquisition or compensation for post-acquisition services.\n",
      "   - \"If continued employment is required for vesting, the awards are treated as compensation for post-acquisition services and recognized as an expense over the requisite service period.\"\n",
