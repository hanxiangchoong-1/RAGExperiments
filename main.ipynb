Business\\nElastic is a data analytics company built on the power of search. Our platform, which is available as both a hosted, \\nmanaged service across public clouds as well as self-managed software, allows our customers to find insights and drive \\nartificial intelligence (“AI”) and machine learning use cases from large amounts of data. We offer three search-powered \\nsolutions – Search, Observability, and Security – that are built into the platform. We help organizations, their employees, and \\ntheir customers find what they need faster, while keeping mission-critical applications running smoothly, and protecting against \\ncyber threats. \\nAs digital transformation drives mission critical business functions to the cloud, we believe that every company will \\nneed to build around a search-based relevance engine to find the answers that matter, from all of their data, in real-time, and at \\nscale. \\nOur platform is built on the Elastic Stack, a powerful set of software products that ingest data from any source, in any \\nformat, and perform search, analysis, and visualization of that data. At the core of the Elastic Stack is Elasticsearch - a highly \\nscalable document store and search engine, and the unified data store for all of our solutions and use cases. Another component \\nof the Elastic Stack is Kibana, which delivers a common user interface across all of our solutions, with powerful drag-and-drop \\nvisual analytics, and centralized management of the platform. Our platform also includes the Elasticsearch Relevance Engine™ \\n(“ESRE”), which combines advanced AI with Elastic’s text search to give developers a full suite of sophisticated retrieval \\nalgorithms and the ability to integrate with large language models. Our out-of-the-box solutions deliver fast time to value for \\ncommon use cases and, paired with our developer-centric platform which is extensible and customizable, allow us to innovate \\nfast and differentiate our offerings at every level. \\nWe make our platform available as a hosted, managed service across major cloud providers (Amazon Web Services \\n(“AWS”), Google Cloud Platform (“GCP”), and Microsoft Azure) in more than 50 public cloud regions globally. Customers \\ncan also deploy our platform across hybrid clouds, public or private clouds, and multi-cloud environments. \\nOur business model is based primarily on a combination of a paid Elastic-managed hosted service offering and paid \\nand free proprietary self-managed software. Our paid offerings for our platform are sold via subscription through resource-\\nbased pricing, and all customers and users have access to all solutions. In Elastic Cloud, our family of cloud-based offerings \\nunder which we offer our software as a hosted, managed service, we offer various subscription tiers tied to different features. \\nFor users who download our software, we make some of the features of our software available for free, allowing us to engage \\nwith a broad community of developers and practitioners and introduce them to the value of the Elastic Stack. We believe in the \\nimportance of an open software development model, and we develop the majority of our software in public repositories as open \\ncode under a proprietary license. Unlike some companies, we do not build an enterprise version that is separate from our free \\ndistribution. We maintain a single code base across both our self-managed software and Elastic-hosted services. All of these \\nactions help us build a powerful commercial business model that we believe is optimized for product-led growth. \\nOur customers often significantly expand their usage of our products and services over time. Expansion includes \\nincreasing the number of developers and practitioners using our products, increasing the utilization of our products for a \\nparticular use case, and utilizing our products to address new use cases. We focus some of our direct sales efforts on \\nencouraging this type of expansion within our customer base, both within as well as across solutions. Because our business \\nmodel provides access to all solutions with resource-based pricing, we make it easy for customers to expand across use cases.\\nOur business has experienced rapid growth around the world. As of April 30, 2023, we had approximately 20,200 \\ncustomers compared to over 18,600 customers and over 15,000 customers as of April 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our total \\nrevenue was $1.1 billion, $862.4 million, and $608.5 million for the years ended April 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, \\nrepresenting year-over-year growth of 24% for the year ended April 30, 2023 and 42% for the year ended April 30, 2022. \\nSubscriptions accounted for 92%, 93% and 93% of our total revenue for the years ended April 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, \\nrespectively. Revenue from outside the United States accounted for 41%, 44% and 45% of our total revenue for the years ended \\nApril 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \\nFor the years ended April 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we incurred net losses of $236.2 million, $203.8 million and \\n$129.4 million, respectively. We expect we will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future.

Our support team is distributed across over 20 \\ncountries and provides coverage 24 hours per day, 365 days per year, across multiple languages. \\nWe believe that software companies should not have incentives to build low-quality software. In that connection, we \\ndo not sell support separately from our software subscriptions. \\nOur Technology \\nOur platform consists of the Elastic Stack, our solutions, and software that supports our various deployment \\nalternatives. Because our solutions are built into the Elastic Stack, innovations and new capabilities in the Elastic Stack may \\nbenefit many of our solutions. Our customers can customize and extend our solutions to fit their needs by leveraging the power \\nof the Elastic Stack and our developer capabilities.\\nTechnology Features of the Elastic Stack\\nElasticsearch is the heart of the Elastic Stack, where users store, search, and analyze data. Key features of \\nElasticsearch include the following:\\n•Store any type of data.  Elasticsearch combines powerful parts of traditional search engines, such as an inverted\\nindex to power fast full text search and a column store for analytics, with native support for a wide range of data\\ntypes, including text, dates, numbers, geospatial data, date/numeric ranges, and IP addresses. With sensible\\ndefaults, and no upfront schema definition necessary, Elasticsearch makes it easy to start simple and fine-tune as\\ndatasets grow.\\n•Vector search.  Elastic natively supports vector search as part of ESRE, which enables a wide range of advanced\\nsearch use cases that improve relevance, including sophisticated search ranking, image search, question\\nanswering, and more. Vector search relies on a next generation of machine learning models that can represent\\nmany types of content as vectors, including text, images, events, and more. ESRE also supports integration with\\nlarge language models. As data volumes and formats explode, this sophisticated approach to search and relevance\\nis becoming important for use cases where delivering maximum relevance is critical.\\n•Machine learning, AI, and alerting.   Machine learning capabilities such as anomaly detection, forecasting, and\\ncategorization are tightly integrated with the Elastic Stack to automatically model the behavior of data, such as\\ntrends and periodicity, in real time in order to identify issues faster, streamline root cause analysis, and reduce\\nfalse positives. Without these capabilities, it can be very difficult to identify issues such as infrastructure problems\\nor intruders in real time across complex, high-volume, fast-moving datasets. In the last few years, we have also\\nadded native support for vector search and model management for advanced machine learning models.\\n•Powerful query languages.  The Elasticsearch query domain specific language is a flexible, expressive search\\nlanguage that exposes a rich set of query capabilities across any kind of data. From simple Boolean operators to\\ncustom relevance functions, users can articulate exactly what they are looking for and bring their own definition of\\nrelevance. The query language also includes a composable aggregation framework that enables users to\\nsummarize, slice, and analyze structured or semi-structured datasets across multiple dimensions. Examples of\\nthese capabilities include tracking the top ten users by expenditure level, looking at data week over week,\\nanalyzing data across geographies, and drilling down into details with specific filters all with a single search.\\n•Developer friendliness.  Elasticsearch has consistent, well-documented APIs that work the same way on one\\nnode during initial development as on a hundred nodes in production. Elasticsearch also ships with a number of\\nlanguage clients that provide a natural way to integrate with a variety of popular programming frameworks,\\nreducing the learning curve, and leading to a shorter time to realizing value.\\n•High speed.   Everything stored in Elasticsearch is indexed by default, so that users do not need to decide in\\nadvance what queries they will want to run. Our architecture optimizes throughput, time-to-data availability and\\nquery latency. Elasticsearch can easily index millions of events per second, and newly added data can be available\\nfor search nearly instantly.\\n8', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Elasticsearch is designed to scale horizontally and be resilient to node or hardware\\nfailures. As nodes join a cluster, data is automatically re-balanced and queries and indexing are spread across the\\nnew nodes seamlessly. This makes it easy to add hardware to increase indexing throughput or improve query\\nthroughput. Elasticsearch also detects node failures and hardware or network issues and automatically protects\\nuser data by ejecting the failing or inaccessible nodes and creating new replicas of the data.\\n•Security.  Security features give administrators the rights to grant specific levels of access to their various types of\\nusers, such as IT, operations, and application teams. Elasticsearch serves as the central authentication hub for the\\nentire Elastic Stack. Security features include encrypted communications and encryption-at-rest; role-based access\\ncontrol; single sign-on and authentication; field-level, attribute-level, and document-level security; and audit\\nlogging.\\nKibana is the user interface for the Elastic Stack. It allows users to manage the Elastic Stack and visualize data. \\nAdditionally, the interfaces for many of our solutions are built into Kibana. Key features of Kibana include the following:\\n•Explore and visualize data stored in Elasticsearch.  Kibana provides interactive data views, visualizations, and\\ndashboards powered by structured filtering and unstructured search to enable users to get to answers more quickly.\\nA variety of data visualization types, such as simple line and bar charts, purpose-built geospatial and time series\\nvisualizations, tree diagrams, network diagrams, heatmaps, scatter plots, and histograms, support diverse user\\nneeds.\\n•Incorporate advanced analytics and machine learning from Elasticsearch.  Kibana’s query, filtering, and data\\nsummarization capabilities reflect Elasticsearch’s powerful query domain specific language and aggregation\\nframework while making it interactive.\\n•Manage the Elastic Stack.   Kibana presents a broad user interface showing the health of Elastic Stack\\ncomponents and provides cluster alerts to notify administrators of problems. Its central management user\\ninterfaces (“UI”) make it easier to operate the Elastic Stack at scale.\\n•Home for Solutions.  Kibana is where our users and customers access the user interfaces for our Search,\\nObservability, and Security solutions. Kibana provides core services, like security, alerting, and data visualization\\ncomponents. This makes it easy for users to discover all of the capabilities our solutions provide, and enables\\nsolution users to benefit from Kibana’s core capabilities.\\n•Application framework.  Kibana is designed to be extensible. Users interested in a highly specialized\\nvisualization type not distributed with Kibana by default can customize experiences through a Kibana plugin and\\nmake the plugin available to the community. Dozens of Kibana plugins have been shared by the community via\\nElastic documentation and code sharing platforms such as GitHub.\\nElastic Agent, Beats, and Logstash are data ingestion tools that enable users to collect and enrich any kind of data from \\nany source for storage in Elasticsearch. Beats and Logstash have an extensible modular architecture. Elastic Agent is a single, \\nunified way to add monitoring for logs, metrics, and other types of data to each host, and also includes integrated host \\nprotection and central management. Beats are lightweight agents purpose-built for collecting data on devices, servers, and \\ninside containers. Key features include the following:\\n•Data shippers.  Elastic Agent introduces a new single agent architecture across hosts that simplifies management\\nand deployment. Elastic Agent is based on the architecture of Beats, lightweight agents built for the purposes of\\nefficient data collection at the edge for specific types of data, such as Filebeat for the collection of logging data,\\nMetricbeat for the collection of system or service metric data, Auditbeat for the collection of security data,\\nPacketbeat for the collection of network data, and Heartbeat for the collection of availability data. Dozens of\\ncommunity Beats enable the collection of data from specialized sources.\\n•Extensibility and community Beats.

Our new employee onboarding experience is centered around attending “X-School”, our \\nextensive new-hire orientation program, which enables new Elasticians to meet and collaborate with other new Elasticians from \\naround the globe and to learn about our products and solutions.\\nEngagement Surveys.  We monitor employee morale and attitudes through two primary feedback mechanisms – an \\nannual employee engagement survey and a mid-year pulse survey check-in. The results of these surveys are reviewed at the \\ncompany, functional, team and manager level, and are used to develop action plans put in place annually. Elasticians were \\nhighly engaged in providing feedback in fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, with high participation rates for the mid-year and \\nannual surveys as well as high engagement scores across a spectrum of questions. \\nLearning and Development\\nOur Learning & Organizational Development team’s mission is to enable Elasticians to pursue their purpose, in work \\nand life. To that end, we have a variety of ways in which we support the continuous learning and development of all Elasticians, \\nincluding access to on-demand video based learning.\\nWe also conduct specific programs to develop managers and leaders at Elastic, including our flagship leadership \\ndevelopment program -  Leading Strategically,  an externally-led program focused on high-performing leaders who possess the \\npotential to have a significant strategic impact on the achievement of our long-term objectives. \\nTotal Rewards\\nCompensation, Benefits and Well-being . We provide market competitive compensation which typically includes cash \\ncompensation as well as equity awards. Reflecting our interest in the whole person, we provide programs designed to enable \\nElasticians to meet their well-being goals, from starting a family to being at their physical and emotional best. These programs \\ninclude market competitive medical and dental programs, in addition to a focus on mental health and holistic well-being. We \\nprovide market competitive paid time off programs, which feature 16 weeks of paid leave to all new parents, life-planning \\nbenefits and other travel reimbursements for certain healthcare services. In addition, we also provide retirement and income \\nprotection plans, which include a 401k plan with a dollar-for-dollar match by Elastic up to 6% of eligible earnings up to a plan-\\nlimit maximum for U.S.-based Elasticians as well as similar competitive plans outside of the United States. \\nFlexible Work Environment . Since inception, we have provided most Elasticians with the ability to work from \\nanywhere, as often as they would like. We also know that being face-to-face is important too, and we have physical offices \\naround the world to provide a space for employees to work from if they wish to do so.\\nCommunity Involvement.  Through our Elastic Cares program, employees can support the charitable organizations that \\nmatter the most to them on a local and global level. This program encompasses donation matching, our nonprofit organization \\nprogram which provides our technology for free to certain nonprofit organizations, and our volunteer time off initiative. \\nEmployees are encouraged to volunteer for these organizations throughout the year using our volunteer time off program which \\nprovides our employees with 40 hours of volunteer time each year.\\nGovernment Regulations\\nOur worldwide business activities are subject to various laws, rules, and regulations of the United States as well as of \\nforeign governments.

Our employee headcount and number of \\ncustomers have increased significantly. For example, our total number of customers has grown from over 2,800 as of April 30, \\n2017 to approximately 20,200 as of April 30, 2023. Further, although we implemented a workforce reduction in November \\n2022 and may modify our hiring to align with our evolving growth plans, our employee headcount generally has increased as \\nwe have expanded our business. The growth and expansion of our business and offerings place a continuous and significant \\nstrain on our management, operational, and financial resources. In addition, as customers adopt our technology for an \\nincreasing number of use cases, we have had to support more complex commercial relationships. We may not be able to \\nleverage, develop and retain qualified employees effectively enough to maintain our growth plans. We must continue to \\nimprove our information technology and financial infrastructure, our operating and administrative systems, our relationships \\nwith various partners and other third parties, and our ability to manage headcount and processes in an efficient manner to \\nmanage our growth effectively. Our failure to do so could result in increased costs, negatively affect our customers’ satisfaction \\nwith our offerings, and harm our results of operations.\\nWe may not be able to sustain the diversity and pace of improvements to our offerings successfully, or implement \\nsystems, processes, and controls in an efficient or timely manner or in a manner that does not negatively affect our results of \\noperations. Our failure to improve our systems, processes, and controls, or their failure to operate in the intended manner, may \\nresult in our inability to manage the growth of our business and to forecast our revenue, expenses, and earnings accurately, or to \\nprevent losses. \\nWe may find it difficult to maintain our corporate culture while managing our headcount. Any failure to manage our \\nanticipated growth and related organizational changes in a manner that preserves our culture could negatively impact our future \\ngrowth and achievement of our business objectives. Additionally, our productivity and the quality of our offerings may be \\nadversely affected if we do not develop our employee talent effectively. \\nWe have a history of losses and may not be able to achieve profitability on a consistent basis or at all, and may not be able to \\nachieve positive operating cash flow on a consistent basis. As a result, our business, financial condition, and results of \\noperations may suffer. \\nWe have incurred losses in all years since our inception. We incurred a net loss of $236.2 million, $203.8 million, and \\n$129.4 million for the years ended April 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As a result, we had an accumulated deficit of \\n$1.1 billion as of April 30, 2023. We anticipate that our operating expenses will continue to increase substantially in the \\nforeseeable future as we continue to enhance our offerings, broaden our customer base and pursue larger transactions, expand \\nour sales and marketing activities, expand our operations, hire additional employees, and continue to develop our technology. \\nThese efforts may prove more expensive than we currently anticipate, and we may not succeed in increasing our revenue \\nsufficiently, or at all, to offset these higher expenses. Revenue growth may slow or revenue may decline for a number of \\nreasons, including slowing demand for our offerings, increasing competition, or economic downturns, including as a result of \\nrising rates of inflation and other macroeconomic events. You should not consider our revenue growth in prior periods as \\nindicative of our future performance. Any failure to increase our revenue or grow our business could prevent us from achieving \\nprofitability at all or on a consistent basis, which would cause our business, financial condition, and results of operations to \\nsuffer. Additionally, although we generated positive operating cash flow in fiscal 2023, any failure to grow our business could \\nprevent us from achieving positive operating cash flow on a consistent basis, which would cause our business, financial \\ncondition, and results of operations to suffer. \\n17', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

We have incurred and will continue to incur substantial costs to develop, sell and support our Elastic \\nCloud offerings. We have also entered into non-cancelable multi-year cloud hosting capacity commitments with certain third-\\nparty cloud providers, which require us to pay for such capacity irrespective of actual usage. We believe that we must offer a \\nfamily of cloud-based products to address the market segment that prefers a cloud-based solution to a self-managed solution \\nand that there will be increasing demand for cloud-based offerings of our products. For the years ended April 30, 2023, 2022, \\nand 2021, Elastic Cloud contributed 40%, 35%, and 27% of our total revenue, respectively. However, as the use of cloud-based \\ncomputing solutions is rapidly evolving, it is difficult to predict the potential growth, if any, of general market adoption, \\ncustomer adoption, and retention rates of our cloud-based offerings. There could be decreased demand for our cloud-based \\nofferings due to reasons within or outside of our control, including, among other things, lack of customer acceptance, \\ntechnological challenges with bringing cloud offerings to market and maintaining those offerings, information security, data \\nprotection, or privacy concerns, our inability to properly manage and support our cloud-based offerings, competing \\ntechnologies and products, weakening economic conditions, and decreases in corporate spending. If we are not able to develop, \\nmarket, or deliver cloud-based offerings that satisfy customer requirements technically or commercially, if our investments in \\ncloud-based offerings do not yield the expected return, or if we are unable to decrease the cost of providing our cloud-based \\nofferings, our business, competitive position, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed.\\nUnfavorable or uncertain conditions in our industry or the global economy or reductions in information technology \\nspending, including as a result of adverse macroeconomic conditions, or Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, could limit our \\nability to grow our business and negatively affect our results of operations. \\nOur results of operations may vary based on the impact of changes in our industry or the global economy on us or our \\ncustomers. Current, future, or sustained economic uncertainties or downturns, whether actual or perceived, could adversely \\naffect our business and results of operations. Negative conditions in the general economy both in the United States and in \\ninternational markets, including conditions resulting from changes in gross domestic product growth, financial and credit \\nmarket fluctuations, international trade relations, changes in inflation, foreign exchange and interest rate environments, \\nrecessionary fears, supply chain constraints, energy costs, political instability, natural catastrophes, warfare, infectious diseases \\nand terrorist attacks, could cause a decrease in business investments by our customers and potential customers, including \\nspending on information technology, and negatively affect the growth of our business. For example, inflation rates have \\nrecently reached levels not seen in decades and may continue to create economic volatility as governments adjust interest rates \\nin an attempt to manage the inflationary environment, which may further lead to our customers tightening their technology \\nspend and investment. Further, the ongoing international political crisis resulting from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could \\ncontinue to have significant negative macroeconomic consequences, including on the businesses of our customers, which could \\nnegatively impact their spending on our offerings. Moreover, instability in the global banking system recently has resulted in \\nfailures of major banks. Any further disruptions or other adverse developments, or concerns or rumors about any such events or \\nsimilar risks, in the financial services industry, both in the U.S. and in international markets, may lead to market-wide liquidity \\nproblems and may impact our or our customers’ liquidity and, as a result, negatively affect the level of customer spending on \\nour offerings.\\nAs a result of the foregoing conditions, our revenue may be disproportionately affected by longer and more \\nunpredictable sales cycles, delays or reductions in customer consumption or in general information technology spending, and \\nfurther impacts of changing foreign exchange rates. Further, current and prospective customers may choose to develop in-house \\nsoftware as an alternative to using our paid products. These factors could increase the amount of customer churn we have \\nexperienced recently and further slow consumption and overall customer expenditure. Moreover, competitors may respond to \\nmarket conditions by lowering prices. Such impacts of the current macroeconomic environment have negatively affected our \\nresults of operations since the first quarter of fiscal 2023. We cannot predict the timing, strength or duration of the current \\neconomic slowdown and instability or any recovery, generally or within our industry. If the economic conditions of the general \\neconomy or markets in which we operate do not improve, or worsen from present levels, our business, results of operations and \\nfinancial condition could be adversely affected.\\nWe may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors. \\nThe market for our products is highly competitive, quickly evolving, fragmented, and subject to rapid changes in \\ntechnology, shifting customer needs, and frequent introductions of new offerings. We believe that our ability to compete \\ndepends upon many factors both within and beyond our control, including the following:\\n• our product capabilities, including speed, scale, and relevance, with which to power search experiences;\\n• our offerings of an extensible product “stack” that enables developers to build a wide variety of solutions;\\n18', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Our success depends upon our ability to continue to innovate, enhance existing products, \\nexpand the use cases of our products, anticipate and respond to changing customer needs, requirements, and preferences, and \\ndevelop and introduce in a timely manner new offerings that keep pace with technological and competitive developments. \\nWe have experienced delays in releasing new products, deployment options, and product enhancements and may \\nexperience similar delays in the future. As a result, in the past, some of our customers deferred purchasing our products until the \\nnext upgrade was released. Future delays or problems in the installation or implementation of our new releases may cause \\ncustomers to forgo purchases of our products and purchase those of our competitors instead. \\nThe success of new product introductions depends on a number of factors including, but not limited to, timely and \\nsuccessful product development, market acceptance, our ability to manage the risks associated with new product releases, the \\navailability of software components for new products, the effective management of development and other spending in \\nconnection with anticipated demand for new products, the availability of newly developed products, and the risk that new \\nproducts may have bugs, errors, or other defects or deficiencies in the early stages of introduction. We have experienced bugs, \\nerrors, or other defects or deficiencies in new products and product updates and may have similar experiences in the future. \\nFurthermore, our ability to increase the usage of our products depends, in part, on the development of new use cases for our \\nproducts, which is typically driven by our developer community and may be outside of our control. We also have invested, and \\nmay continue to invest, in the acquisition of complementary businesses, technologies, services, products and other assets that \\nexpand the products that we can offer our customers. We may make these investments without being certain that they will result \\nin products or enhancements that will be accepted by existing or prospective customers. If we are unable to successfully \\nenhance our existing products to meet evolving customer requirements, increase adoption and usage of our products, develop \\nnew products, or if our efforts to increase the usage of our products are more expensive than we expect, then our business, \\nresults of operations, and financial condition would be adversely affected. \\nSales of our products could suffer if the markets for those products do not grow or if we fail to adapt and respond effectively \\nto evolving markets. \\nThe markets for certain of our products, such as our Search, Observability and Security solutions, are evolving and our \\nproducts are relatively new in these markets.

Other U.S. states and the U.S. federal government are considering or have enacted \\nsimilar privacy legislation. Many obligations under these laws and legislative proposals remain uncertain, and we cannot fully \\npredict their impact on our business. Failure to comply with these varying laws and standards may subject us to investigations, \\nenforcement actions, civil litigation, fines and other penalties, all of which may generate negative publicity and have a negative \\nimpact on our business. \\nInternationally, most jurisdictions in which we operate have established their own privacy, data protection and \\ninformation security legal frameworks with which we or our customers must comply. Within the European Union, the General \\nData Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) applies to the processing of personal data. The GDPR imposes significant obligations \\nupon our business and compliance with these obligations can vary depending on how different regulators may interpret them. \\nFailure to comply, or perceived failure to comply, can result in administrative fines of up to 20 million Euros or four percent of \\nthe group’s annual global turnover, whichever is higher. Similarly, the United Kingdom has implemented legislation that is \\nsubstantially similar to the EU GDPR where penalties for violations, actual or perceived, can be up to 17.5 million British \\nPound Sterling or four percent of the group’s annual global turnover, whichever is higher, all of which may be subject to \\nchange with the introduction of the Data Protection and Digital Information (DPDI) Bill in 2022. The potential impact to our \\nbusiness remains unclear. \\nOn June 4, 2021, the European Commission issued new Standard Contractual Clauses (“SCC”) applicable to cross-\\nborder data transfers of personal data for people located in the EEA. On February 2, 2022, the United Kingdom’s Information \\nCommissioner’s Office issued new standard contractual clauses to support personal data transfers out of the United Kingdom \\n(“UK SCC”), which went into effect on March 21, 2022. In light of these and other ongoing developments relating to cross-\\nborder data transfer, we may experience additional costs associated with increased compliance burdens, and this regulation may \\nimpact our ability to transfer personal data across our organization, to customers, or to third parties.\\nIn addition to government regulation, industry groups have established or may establish new and different self-\\nregulatory standards that may legally or contractually apply to us or our customers. One example of such a self-regulatory \\nstandard is the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (“PCI DSS”), which relates to the processing of payment card \\ninformation. Further, our customers increasingly expect us to comply with more stringent privacy, data protection, and \\ninformation security requirements than those imposed by laws, regulations, or self-regulatory requirements, and we may be \\nobligated contractually to comply with additional or different standards relating to our handling or protection of data on or by \\nour offerings. Any failure to meet our customers’ requirements may adversely affect our revenues and prospects for growth. \\nWe also expect that there will continue to be changes in interpretations of existing or new laws and regulations, \\nproposed laws, and other obligations, which could impair our or our customers’ ability to process personal data, decrease \\ndemand for our offerings, impact our marketing efforts, increase our costs, and impair our ability to maintain and grow our \\ncustomer base and increase our revenue. It is possible that these laws and regulations or other actual or asserted obligations \\nrelating to privacy, data protection, or information security may be interpreted and applied in manners that are, or are alleged to \\nbe, inconsistent with our data management practices or the features of our products. In such an event, we could face fines, \\nlawsuits, regulatory investigations, and other claims and penalties, and we could be required to fundamentally change our \\nproducts or our business practices, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business. \\nData protection authorities and other regulatory bodies are increasingly focused on the use of online tracking tools and \\nhave issued or plan to issue rulings which may impact our marketing practices. Any restrictions on using online analytics and \\ntracking tools could lead to substantial costs, require significant changes to our policies and practices, limit the effectiveness of \\nour marketing activities, divert the attention of our technology personnel, adversely affect our margins, and subject us to \\nadditional liabilities. \\nWe publicly post privacy statements and other documentation regarding our practices concerning the processing, use \\nand disclosure of personal data.

The rate at \\nwhich our existing customers purchase additional subscriptions and expand the value of existing subscriptions depends on a \\nnumber of factors, including customers’ level of satisfaction with our offerings, the nature and size of the deployments, the \\ndesire to address additional use cases, the perceived need for additional features, and general economic conditions. If our \\nexisting customers do not purchase additional subscriptions or expand the value of their subscriptions, our Net Expansion Rate \\nmay decline. We rely in large part on our customers to identify new use cases for our products in order to expand such \\ndeployments and grow our business. If our customers do not recognize the potential of our offerings, our business would be \\nmaterially and adversely affected. If our efforts to sell subscriptions to new customers and to expand deployments at existing \\ncustomers are not successful, our total revenue and revenue growth rate may decline, and our business will suffer. \\nIf our existing customers do not renew their subscriptions, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected. \\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenue from renewals of existing subscriptions. Our customers have no \\ncontractual obligation to renew their subscriptions after the completion of their subscription term. Our subscriptions for self-\\nmanaged deployments typically range from one to three years, while many of our Elastic Cloud customers purchase \\nsubscriptions either on a month-to-month basis or on a committed contract of at least one year in duration. \\n25', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

If our \\ncustomers renew their subscriptions, they may renew for shorter subscription terms or on other terms that are less economically \\nbeneficial to us. If our existing customers do not renew their subscriptions, or renew on less favorable terms, our revenue may \\ngrow more slowly than expected or decline.\\nThe length of our sales cycle can be unpredictable, particularly with respect to sales through our channel partners or sales \\nto large customers, and our sales efforts may require considerable time and expense. \\nOur results of operations may fluctuate, in part, because of the length and variability of the sales cycle of our \\nsubscriptions and the difficulty in making short-term adjustments to our operating expenses. Our results of operations depend in \\npart on sales to new customers, including large customers, and increasing sales to existing customers. The length of our sales \\ncycle, from initial contact with our sales team to contractually committing to our subscriptions, can vary substantially from \\ncustomer to customer based on deal complexity as well as whether a sale is made directly by us or through a channel partner. \\nOur sales cycle can extend to more than a year for some customers, and the length of sales cycles may be further impacted due \\nto worsening economic conditions. In addition, some customers have been scrutinizing their spending more carefully and \\nreducing their consumption spending given the current uncertain economic environment, and we generally expect this to \\ncontinue. We have also experienced and, if adverse economic conditions persist, may continue to experience longer and more \\nunpredictable sales cycles. As we target more of our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers, we may face greater costs, \\nlonger sales cycles, greater competition and less predictability in completing some of our sales. A customer’s decision to use \\nour solutions may be an enterprise-wide decision, which may require greater levels of education regarding the use cases of our \\nproducts or protracted negotiations. In addition, larger customers may demand more configuration, integration services and \\nfeatures. It is difficult to predict exactly when, or even if, we will make a sale to a potential customer or if we can increase sales \\nto our existing customers. As a result, large individual sales, in some cases, have occurred in quarters subsequent to those we \\nexpected, or have not occurred at all. Lengthened or unpredictable sales cycles that cause a loss or delay of one or more large \\ntransactions in a quarter could affect our cash flows and results of operations for that quarter and for future quarters. These \\nimpacts are amplified in the short term when customers slow their consumption in response to the uncertain macroeconomic \\nenvironment. Because a substantial proportion of our expenses are relatively fixed in the short term, our cash flows and results \\nof operations will suffer if revenue falls below our expectations in a particular quarter. \\nOur decision to no longer offer Elasticsearch and Kibana under an open source license may harm the adoption of \\nElasticsearch and Kibana.\\nIn February 2021, with the release of version 7.11 of the Elastic Stack, we changed the source code of Elasticsearch \\nand Kibana which had historically been licensed under Apache 2.0, to be dual licensed under Elastic License 2.0 and the Server \\nSide Public License Version 1.0 (“SSPL”), at the user’s election. Neither the Elastic License nor the SSPL has been approved \\nby the Open Source Initiative or is included in the Free Software Foundation’s list of free software licenses. Further, neither has \\nbeen interpreted by any court. While the vast majority of downloads of Elasticsearch and Kibana from mid-2018 through early \\n2021 were licensed under the Elastic License, the removal of the Apache 2.0 alternative could negatively impact certain \\ndevelopers for whom the availability of an open source license was important. In addition, some developers and the companies \\nfor whom they work may be hesitant to download or upgrade to new versions of Elasticsearch or Kibana under the Elastic \\nLicense or SSPL because of uncertainty regarding how these licenses may be interpreted and enforced. Other developers, \\nincluding competitors of Elastic such as Amazon, have announced that they have “forked” Elasticsearch and Kibana, which \\nmeans they have developed their own product or service that is based on features of Elasticsearch and Kibana that we had \\npreviously made available under an open source license. For example, Amazon has launched an open source project called \\nOpenSearch based on a forked version of the Elastic Stack, which is licensed under Apache 2.0, and rebranded their existing \\nElasticsearch Service as OpenSearch Service. The combination of uncertainty around our dual license model and the potential \\ncompetition from the forked versions of our software may negatively impact adoption of Elasticsearch and Kibana, which in \\nturn could lead to reduced brand and product awareness and to a decline in paying customers, which could harm our ability to \\ngrow our business or achieve profitability.\\n26', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Our business and results of operations will be \\nharmed if our sales and marketing efforts do not generate significant revenue increases or increases that are smaller than \\nanticipated. \\nWe may not achieve revenue growth from expanding our sales force if we are unable to hire, train, and retain talented \\nand effective sales personnel. We depend on our sales force to obtain new customers and to drive additional sales to existing \\ncustomers.

Our ability to achieve significant revenue growth will \\ndepend, in large part, on our success in recruiting, training and retaining sufficient sales personnel to support our growth, and as \\nwe introduce new products, solutions, and marketing strategies, we may need to re-train existing sales personnel. For example, \\nwe may need to provide additional training and development to our sales personnel in relation to understanding and selling \\nconsumption-based arrangements and expanding customer usage of our offerings over time. New hires also require extensive \\ntraining which may take significant time before they achieve full productivity.

Many larger enterprise and government entity customers have more \\ncomplex IT environments and require higher levels of support than smaller customers. If we fail to meet the requirements of \\nthese enterprise customers, it may be more difficult to grow sales with them. \\nAdditionally, it can take several months to recruit, hire, and train qualified technical support employees. We may not \\nbe able to hire such employees fast enough to keep up with demand, particularly if the sales of our offerings exceed our internal \\nforecasts. Due to the uncertainty related to macroeconomic conditions, there may also be more competition for qualified \\nemployees and delays in hiring, onboarding, and training new employees. To the extent that we are unsuccessful in hiring, \\ntraining, and retaining adequate support resources, our ability to provide adequate and timely support to our customers, and our \\ncustomers’ satisfaction with our offerings, will be adversely affected. Our failure to provide and maintain, or a market \\nperception that we do not provide or maintain, high-quality support services would have an adverse effect on our business, \\nfinancial condition, and results of operations. \\nBecause we recognize the vast majority of the revenue from subscriptions, either based on actual consumption, monthly, or \\nratably, over the term of the relevant subscription period, downturns or upturns in sales are not immediately reflected in full \\nin our results of operations. \\nSubscription revenue accounts for the substantial majority of our revenue, comprising 92%, 93%, and 93% of total \\nrevenue for the years ended April 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The effect of significant downturns in new or renewed \\nsales of our subscriptions is not reflected in full in our results of operations until future periods. We recognize the vast majority \\nof our subscription revenue, either based on actual consumption, monthly, or ratably, over the term of the relevant time period. \\nAs a result, much of the subscription revenue we report each fiscal quarter represents the recognition of deferred revenue from \\nsubscription contracts entered into during previous fiscal quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in \\nany one fiscal quarter will not be fully or immediately reflected in revenue in that fiscal quarter and will negatively affect our \\nrevenue in future fiscal quarters. \\nWe do not have an adequate history with our consumption-based arrangements for our Elastic Cloud offerings to predict \\naccurately the long-term rate of customer adoption or renewal, or the impact those arrangements will have on our near-term \\nor long-term revenue or operating results.\\nWe expect that our consumption-based arrangements for our Elastic Cloud offerings will continue to increase, both in \\namount and as a percentage of our total revenue. Because we recognize revenue under a consumption-based arrangement based \\non actual customer consumption, we do not have the same visibility into the timing of revenue recognition as we do under \\nsubscription arrangements where revenue is recognized on a predetermined schedule over the subscription term. Additionally, \\ncustomers may consume our products at a different pace than we expect. For example, we have experienced and, if adverse \\neconomic conditions persist, may continue to experience slowing consumption as customers look to optimize their usage. \\nAdditionally, we have seen and may continue to see newer customers increase their consumption of our solutions at a slower \\npace than our more tenured customers.

We rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, patents, contractual restrictions, and other intellectual \\nproperty laws and confidentiality procedures to establish and protect our proprietary rights. The steps we take to protect our \\nintellectual property rights may be inadequate. We will not be able to protect our intellectual property rights if we are unable to \\nenforce our rights or if we do not detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights. The source code of the proprietary \\nfeatures for the Elastic Stack is publicly available, which may enable others to replicate our proprietary technology and compete \\nmore effectively. If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, our competitors may gain access to our \\nproprietary technology and our business may be harmed. In addition, defending our intellectual property rights might entail \\nsignificant expense. Any patents, trademarks, or other intellectual property rights that we have or may obtain may be challenged \\nby others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation. Patent applications we file may not result in issued patents. \\nEven if we continue to seek patent protection in the future, we may be unable to obtain further patent protection for our \\ntechnology. In addition, any patents issued in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages, or may be \\nsuccessfully challenged by third parties. Furthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability, and scope of \\nprotection of intellectual property rights are uncertain. Despite our precautions, it may be possible for unauthorized third parties \\nto copy our products and use information that we regard as proprietary to create offerings that compete with ours. Effective \\npatent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our products are \\navailable. We may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names or trademarks that are similar to, infringe \\nupon, or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights. The laws of some countries are not as protective of \\nintellectual property rights as those in the United States, and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be \\ninadequate. As we expand our international activities, our exposure to unauthorized copying and use of our products and \\nproprietary information will likely increase. \\nWe enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and enter into \\nconfidentiality agreements with other parties. These agreements may not be effective in controlling access to and distribution of \\nour proprietary information. Further, these agreements may not prevent our competitors from independently developing \\ntechnologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our products. Our ability to enforce such agreements may be \\nadversely affected if the Federal Trade Commission adopts a rule it proposed in January 2023 that would prohibit non-compete \\nprovisions in employment agreements. Although the proposed rule generally would not apply to other types of employment \\nrestrictions, such as confidentiality agreements, such employment restrictions could be subject to the rule if they are so broad in \\nscope that they function as non-competes.\\nIn order to protect our intellectual property rights, we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and \\nprotect our intellectual property rights. Litigation has previously been, and may in the future be, necessary to enforce our \\nintellectual property rights and to protect our trade secrets. Even if we prevail in such disputes, we may not be able to recover \\nall or a portion of any judgments, and litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, \\ntime-consuming, and distracting to management. If unsuccessful, litigation could result in the impairment or loss of portions of \\nour intellectual property. Further, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, \\ncounterclaims, and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. Our inability to \\nprotect our proprietary technology against unauthorized copying or use, as well as any costly litigation or diversion of our \\nmanagement’s attention and resources, could delay further sales or the implementation of our products, impair the functionality \\nof our products, delay introductions of new products, result in our substituting inferior or more costly technologies into our \\nproducts, or injure our reputation. \\nWe could incur substantial costs as a result of any claim of infringement, misappropriation or violation of another party’s \\nintellectual property rights. \\nIn recent years, there has been significant litigation involving patents and other intellectual property rights in the \\nsoftware industry. Companies providing software are increasingly bringing and becoming subject to suits alleging infringement, \\nmisappropriation or violation of proprietary rights, particularly patent rights, and to the extent we gain greater market visibility, \\nwe face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement, misappropriation or violation claims. The risk of \\npatent litigation has been amplified by the increase in the number of a type of patent holder, which we refer to as a non-\\npracticing entity, whose sole or principal business is to assert such claims and against whom our own intellectual property \\nportfolio may provide little deterrent value. We could incur substantial costs in prosecuting or defending any intellectual \\nproperty litigation.

In addition, there have been claims challenging the ownership rights in open source software against \\ncompanies that incorporate open source software into their products, and the licensors of such open source software provide no \\nwarranties or indemnities with respect to such claims.

Contracts with government agencies, including classified contracts, are subject to extensive, \\nevolving and sometimes complex regulations, as well as audits and reviews of contractors’ administrative processes and other \\ncontract related compliance obligations. Breaches of government contracts, failure to comply with applicable regulations or \\nunfavorable findings from government audits or reviews could result in contract terminations, reputational harm or other \\nadverse consequences, including but not limited to ineligibility to sell to government agencies in the future, the government \\nrefusing to continue buying our subscriptions, a reduction of revenue, or fines or civil or criminal liability, which could \\nadversely affect our results of operations in a material way. \\nUnanticipated changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax \\nreturns could expose us to greater than anticipated tax liabilities. \\nOur income tax obligations are based in part on our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements, including the \\nmanner in which we develop, value, and use our intellectual property and the valuations of our intercompany transactions. The \\ntax laws applicable to our business, including the laws of the Netherlands, the United States and other jurisdictions, are subject \\nto change and interpretation. Any new legislation or interpretations of existing legislation could impact our tax obligations in \\ncountries where we do business or cause us to change the way we operate our business and result in increased taxation of our \\ninternational earnings. \\nFor example, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”)/G20 Inclusive Framework has \\nbeen working on addressing the tax challenges arising from the digitalization of the economy, including by releasing the \\nOECD’s Pillar One and Pillar Two blueprints on October 12, 2020. Pillar One refers to the re-allocation of taxing rights to \\njurisdictions where sustained and significant business is conducted, regardless of a physical presence, while Pillar Two \\nestablishes a minimum tax to be paid by multinational enterprises. On December 15, 2022, the Council of the EU formally \\nadopted Directive (EU) 2022/2523 (the “Pillar Two Directive”) to achieve a coordinated implementation of Pillar Two in EU \\nMember States consistent with EU law. On May 31, 2023, the Dutch State Secretary of Finance submitted a proposal of law for \\nthe Minimum Tax Rate Act 2024 (Wet minimumbelasting 2024) to Dutch parliament, which would effectively implement the \\nPillar Two initiative in Dutch law, with an effective date of December 31, 2023. This measure will ensure that multinational \\nenterprises that are within the scope of the Pillar Two rules will always be subject to a corporation tax rate of at least 15%. The \\nproposal of law is subject to amendment during the course of the legislative process and needs to be approved by both chambers \\nof the Dutch parliament before it can enter into force. We do not currently believe that, if enacted, the Minimum Tax Rate Act \\n2024 will have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\\nIn 2022, the United States enacted legislation implementing several changes to U.S. tax laws, including a 15% \\ncorporate alternative minimum tax on applicable corporations with an average adjusted financial statement income (AFSI) in \\nexcess of $1 billion for any three consecutive years preceding the tax year at issue. In addition, on January 1, 2022, a provision \\nof the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 went into effect that eliminates the option to deduct domestic research and development \\ncosts in the year incurred and instead requires taxpayers to amortize such costs over five years.

Tax authorities examine and may audit our income tax returns and other non-income tax \\nreturns, such as payroll, sales, value-added, net worth or franchise, property, goods and services, and excise taxes, in both the \\nUnited States and foreign jurisdictions. It is possible that tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken, and \\nany adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our financial position and results of operations. \\nFurther, the determination of our worldwide provision for, or benefit from, income taxes and other tax liabilities requires \\nsignificant judgment by management, and there are transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.

The amount of taxes we pay in these jurisdictions \\ncould increase substantially as a result of changes in the applicable tax principles, including increased tax rates, new tax laws or \\nrevised interpretations of existing tax laws and precedents. In addition, the authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate \\ncould review our tax returns or require us to file tax returns in jurisdictions in which we do not otherwise file such returns, and \\ncould impose additional tax, interest and penalties. These authorities could also claim that various withholding requirements \\napply to us or our subsidiaries, assert that benefits of tax treaties are not available to us or our subsidiaries, or challenge our \\nmethodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements, including our transfer pricing. The relevant \\ntaxing authorities may determine that the manner in which we operate our business does not achieve the intended tax \\nconsequences. If such a disagreement were to occur, and our position were not sustained, we could be required to pay additional \\ntaxes, and interest and penalties. Additionally, the distributed nature of our workforce on employee locations may increase the \\nprobability of payroll tax audits. Any increase in the amount of taxes we pay or that are imposed on us could increase our \\nworldwide effective tax rate and harm our business and results of operations. \\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations. \\nAs of April 30, 2023, we had net operating loss carryforwards (“NOL”) for Netherlands, United States (federal and \\nstate, respectively) and United Kingdom income tax purposes of $1.0 billion, $973.4 million, $665.0 million and $74.5 million, \\nrespectively, which may be utilized against future income taxes. Limitations imposed by the applicable jurisdictions on our \\nability to utilize NOLs could cause income taxes to be paid earlier than would be paid if such limitations were not in effect and \\ncould cause such NOLs to expire unused, in each case reducing or eliminating the benefit of such NOLs. Furthermore, we may \\nnot be able to generate sufficient taxable income to utilize our NOLs before they expire. If any of these events occur, we may \\nnot derive some or all of the expected benefits from our NOLs.\\nSeasonality may cause fluctuations in our sales and results of operations.\\nHistorically, we have experienced quarterly fluctuations and seasonality in our sales and results of operations based on \\nthe timing of our entry into agreements with new and existing customers and the mix between annual and monthly contracts \\nentered in each reporting period. Trends in our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are impacted \\nby seasonality in our sales cycle, which generally reflects a trend toward greater sales in our second and fourth quarters and \\nlower sales in our first and third quarters, though we believe this trend has been somewhat masked by our overall growth. We \\nexpect that this seasonality will continue to affect our results of operations in the future, and might become more pronounced as \\nwe continue to target larger enterprise customers.\\nRisks Related to Regulatory Matters\\nWe are subject to governmental export and import controls and economic sanctions programs that could impair our ability \\nto compete in international markets or subject us to liability if we violate these controls. \\nOur software and services, in some cases, are subject to U.S. export control laws and regulations including the Export \\nAdministration Regulations (“EAR”), and trade and economic sanctions maintained by OFAC as well as similar laws and \\nregulations in the countries in which we do business. As such, an export license may be required to export or re-export our \\nsoftware and services to, or import our software and services into, certain countries and to certain end-users or for certain end-\\nuses. If we were to fail to comply with such U.S. and foreign export control laws and regulations, trade and economic sanctions, \\nor other similar laws, we could be subject to both civil and criminal penalties, including substantial fines, possible incarceration \\nfor employees and managers for willful violations, and the possible loss of our export or import privileges. Obtaining the \\nnecessary export license for a particular sale or offering may not be possible and may be time-consuming and may result in the \\ndelay or loss of sales opportunities. Furthermore, export control laws and economic sanctions in many cases prohibit the export \\nof software and services to certain embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments and persons, as well as for prohibited end-\\nuses. Monitoring and ensuring compliance with these complex U.S. export control laws involves uncertainties because our \\nofferings are widely distributed throughout the world, and information available on the users of these offerings is, in some \\ncases, limited. Even though we take precautions to ensure that we and our partners comply with all relevant export control laws \\nand regulations, any failure by us or our partners to comply with such laws and regulations could have negative consequences \\nfor us, including reputational harm, government investigations and penalties. \\n38', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

In particular, stock prices of companies with significant operating losses have recently \\ndeclined significantly, and in many instances more significantly than stock prices of companies with operating profits. The \\neconomic impact and uncertainty of changes in the inflation, interest and macroeconomic environments, and Russia’s invasion \\nof Ukraine have exacerbated this volatility in both the overall stock markets and the market price of our ordinary shares. A \\nsignificant decline in the price of our shares could have an adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention.

Were this position to change, payment of future dividends may be made only if our equity exceeds the \\namount of the paid-in and called-up part of the issued share capital, increased by the reserves required to be maintained by \\nDutch law or by our articles of association. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their ordinary shares after price \\nappreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments. \\nClaims of U.S. civil liabilities may not be enforceable against us. \\nWe are incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands and substantial portions of our assets are located outside of the \\nUnited States. In addition, two members of our board of directors and certain experts named in our filings with the SEC reside \\noutside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon \\nus or such other persons residing outside the United States, or to enforce outside the United States judgments obtained against \\nsuch persons in U.S. courts in any action, including actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal \\nsecurities laws. In addition, it may be difficult for investors to enforce, in original actions brought in courts in jurisdictions \\nlocated outside the United States, rights predicated upon the U.S. federal securities laws. \\nThere is no treaty between the United States and the Netherlands for the mutual recognition and enforcement of \\njudgments (other than arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, a final judgment rendered by any federal \\nor state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon the U.S. federal securities laws, \\nwould not be enforceable in the Netherlands unless the underlying claim is re-litigated before a Dutch court of competent \\njurisdiction. In such proceedings, however, a Dutch court may be expected to recognize the binding effect of a judgment of a \\nfederal or state court in the United States without re-examination of the substantive matters adjudicated thereby, if (i) the \\njurisdiction of the U.S. federal or state court has been based on internationally accepted principles of private international law, \\n(ii) that judgment resulted from legal proceedings compatible with Dutch notions of due process, (iii) that judgment does not\\ncontravene public policy of the Netherlands and (iv) that judgment is not incompatible with (x) an earlier judgment of a Dutch\\ncourt between the same parties, or (y) an earlier judgment of a foreign court between the same parties in a dispute regarding the\\nsame subject and based on the same cause, if that earlier foreign judgment is recognizable in the Netherlands.\\n42', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

For purposes of the PFIC asset test, \\nthe value of our assets will generally be determined by reference to our market capitalization. Based on our past and current \\nprojections of our income and assets, we do not expect to be a PFIC for the current taxable year or for the foreseeable future. \\nNevertheless, a separate factual determination as to whether we are or have become a PFIC must be made each year (after the \\nclose of such year). Since our projections may differ from our actual business results and our market capitalization and value of \\nour assets may fluctuate, we cannot assure you that we will not be or become a PFIC in the current taxable year or any future \\ntaxable year. If we are a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. person (as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Internal \\nRevenue Code of 1986, as amended) holds our ordinary shares, such U.S. person may be subject to adverse tax consequences. \\nEach U.S. person who holds our ordinary shares is strongly urged to consult his, her or its tax advisor regarding the application \\nof these rules and the availability of any potential elections. \\nIf a U.S. person is treated as owning at least 10% of our ordinary shares, such U.S. person may be subject to adverse U.S. \\nfederal income tax consequences. \\nIf a U.S. person is treated as owning (directly, indirectly, or constructively) at least 10% of the total combined voting \\npower of our shares, or of the total value of our shares, such shareholder may be treated as a “United States shareholder” with \\nrespect to each “controlled foreign corporation” in our group (if any). Because our group includes one or more U.S. \\nsubsidiaries, certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries could be treated as controlled foreign corporations (regardless of whether we \\nare treated as a controlled foreign corporation). A United States shareholder of a controlled foreign corporation may be required \\nto report annually and include in its U.S. taxable income its pro rata share of “Subpart F income,” “global intangible low-taxed \\nincome,” and investments in U.S. property by controlled foreign corporations, regardless of whether we make any distributions. \\nAn individual that is a United States shareholder with respect to a controlled foreign corporation generally would not be \\nallowed certain tax deductions or foreign tax credits that would be allowed to a United States shareholder that is a U.S. \\ncorporation. We cannot provide any assurances that we will assist investors in determining whether we or any of our non-U.S. \\nsubsidiaries is treated as a controlled foreign corporation or whether any investor is treated as a United States shareholder with \\nrespect to any such controlled foreign corporation or furnish to any investor who may be a United States shareholder \\ninformation that may be necessary to comply with the aforementioned reporting and tax paying obligations.

The term “Qualifying Interest” means a direct or indirectly held interest either by an entity \\nindividually or jointly if an entity is part of a collaborating group ( samenwerkende groep ) that enables such entity or such \\ncollaborating group to exercise a definite influence over another entity’s decisions, such as our company or an entity holding \\nordinary shares, as the case may be, and allows it to determine the other entity’s activities.

The \\nAlternative Withholding Tax will be reduced, but not below zero, with any Regular Dividend Withholding Tax imposed on \\ndistributions.

A qualifying jurisdiction is a jurisdiction other than a member state of the EU/\\nEEA which does not impose a withholding tax on distributions, or that does impose such tax but that grants a step-up for \\nearnings attributable to the period before we become exclusively a resident in such jurisdiction. This deemed distribution will \\nbe subject to a 15% tax insofar it exceeds a franchise of EUR 50 million. The tax is payable by us as a withholding agent. A full \\nexemption applies to entities and individuals that are resident in an EU/EEA member state or a state that has concluded a tax \\ntreaty with the Netherlands that contains a dividend article, provided we submit a declaration confirming the satisfaction of \\napplicable conditions by qualifying shareholders within one month following the taxable event. We will be deemed to have \\nwithheld the tax on the deemed distribution and have a statutory right to recover this from our shareholders. Dutch resident \\nshareholders qualifying for the exemption are entitled to a credit or refund, and non-Dutch resident shareholders qualifying for \\nthe exemption are entitled to a refund, subject to applicable statutory limitations, provided the tax has been actually recovered \\nfrom them.\\nThe DWT Exit Tax has been amended several times since the initial proposal of law and is under ongoing discussion. \\nIn addition, a critical reaction from authorities to the latest proposal of law have been published.

In addition, if we are unsuccessful at integrating future acquisitions, or the technologies associated with \\nsuch acquisitions, into our company, the revenue and results of operations of the combined company could be adversely \\naffected. Any integration process may require significant time and resources, which may disrupt our ongoing business and \\ndivert management’s attention from operations, and we may not be able to manage the integration process successfully. We \\nmay not successfully evaluate or utilize acquired technology or personnel, realize anticipated synergies from acquisitions, or \\naccurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition transaction and integration of such acquisition, including accounting \\ncharges. We may have to pay cash, incur debt, or issue equity or equity-linked securities to pay for any future acquisitions, each \\nof which could adversely affect our financial condition or the market price of our ordinary shares. The sale of equity or issuance \\nof equity-linked debt to finance any future acquisitions could result in dilution to our shareholders. The incurrence of \\nindebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could also include covenants or other restrictions that would \\nimpede our ability to manage our operations. We may acquire development stage companies that are not yet profitable, and that \\nrequire continued investment, thereby reducing our cash available for other corporate purposes. The occurrence of any of these \\nrisks could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\\nCatastrophic events, or man-made events such as terrorism, may disrupt our business. \\nA significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, fire, flood, or significant power outage, could have an adverse \\nimpact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

We have a number of our employees and \\nexecutive officers located in the San Francisco Bay Area, a region that has recently been affected by wildfires and other \\nextreme weather events.

Our platform, which is available as both a hosted, \\nmanaged service across public clouds as well as self-managed software, allows our customers to find insights and drive AI and \\nmachine learning use cases from large amounts of data. We offer three search-powered solutions – Search, Observability, and \\nSecurity – that are built into the platform. We help organizations, their employees, and their customers find what they need \\nfaster, while keeping mission-critical applications running smoothly, and protecting against cyber threats.\\nOur platform is built on the Elastic Stack, a powerful set of software products that ingest data from any source, in any \\nformat, and perform search, analysis, and visualization of that data. At the core of the Elastic Stack is Elasticsearch - a highly \\nscalable document store and search engine, and the unified data store for all of our solutions and use cases. Our platform also \\nincludes the ESRE, which combines advanced AI with Elastic’s text search to give developers a full suite of sophisticated \\nretrieval algorithms and the ability to integrate with large language models. The Elastic Stack can be used by developers to \\npower a variety of use cases. It is a distributed, real-time search and analytics engine and data store for all types of data, \\nincluding textual, numerical, geospatial, structured, and unstructured.\\nWe make our platform available as a hosted, managed service across major cloud providers. Customers can also \\ndeploy our platform across hybrid clouds, public or private clouds, and multi-cloud environments. As digital transformation \\ndrives mission critical business functions to the cloud, we believe that every company will need to build around a search-based \\nrelevance engine to find the answers that matter, from all of their data, in real-time, and at scale.\\nOur business model is based primarily on a combination of a paid Elastic-managed hosted service offering and paid \\nand free proprietary self-managed software. Our paid offerings for our platform are sold via subscription through resource-\\nbased pricing, and all customers and users have access to all solutions. In Elastic Cloud, our family of cloud-based offerings \\nunder which we offer our software as a hosted, managed service, we offer various subscription tiers tied to different features. \\nFor users who download our software, we make some of the features of our software available for free, allowing us to engage \\nwith a broad community of developers and practitioners and introduce them to the value of the Elastic Stack. We believe in the \\nimportance of an open software development model, and we develop the majority of our software in public repositories as open \\ncode under a proprietary license. Unlike some companies, we do not build an enterprise version that is separate from our free \\ndistribution. We maintain a single code base across both our self-managed software and Elastic-hosted services. All of these \\nactions help us build a powerful commercial business model that we believe is optimized for product-led growth. \\nWe generate revenue primarily from sales of subscriptions to our platform. We offer various paid subscription tiers \\nthat provide different levels of rights to use proprietary features and access to support. We do not sell support separately. Our \\nsubscription agreements typically range from one to three years and are usually billed annually in advance. Our subscription \\nagreements are both term-based and consumption-based, with the vast majority of Elastic Cloud subscriptions being \\nconsumption-based. We sell subscriptions in various currencies, with the majority of our subscriptions contracted in US dollars, \\nand a smaller portion contracted in Euro, British Pound Sterling, and other currencies. Elastic Cloud customers may also \\npurchase subscriptions on a month-to-month basis without a commitment, with usage billed at the end of each month. \\nSubscriptions accounted for 92%, 93%, and 93% of total revenue for the years ended April 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021, \\nrespectively. We also generate revenue from consulting and training services.\\n50', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

For the year ended \\nApril 30, 2023, revenue from outside the United States accounted for 41% of our total revenue.

No customer \\naccounted for more than 10% of our total revenue for the years ended April 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021. We have not been \\nprofitable to date. For the years ended April 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we incurred net losses of $236.2 million, $203.8 million \\nand $129.4 million, respectively. Our net cash provided by operating activities was $35.7 million, $5.7 million, and \\n$22.5 million for the years ended April 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

With a distributed team spanning over 40 countries, we are able to recruit, hire, and retain high-quality, \\nexperienced technical and sales personnel and operate at a rapid pace to drive product releases, fix bugs, and create and market \\nnew products. We had 2,886 employees as of April 30, 2023.\\nCurrent Economic Conditions\\nRecent and current macroeconomic events, including inflation, slower economic growth, political unrest, and concerns \\nabout the stability of banks, continue to evolve and negatively impact worldwide economic activity. Governmental and \\ncorporate responses to these factors including rising interest rates, unpredictable and decreased spending, and layoffs, have \\nadded to the highly volatile macroeconomic landscape. We have experienced and, if economic conditions continue to decline, \\nwe may continue to experience longer and more unpredictable sales cycles, increased scrutiny of deals, slowing consumption \\nand overall customer expenditures, and the impacts of changing foreign exchange rates with a strengthening or weakening U.S. \\ndollar. We continue to closely monitor the macroeconomic environment and its effects on our business and on global economic \\nactivity, including customer spending behavior.

On November 30, 2022, we announced and began implementing a plan to align our investments more closely with our \\nstrategic priorities by reducing our workforce by approximately 13% and implementing certain facilities-related cost \\noptimization actions.

See “Risk Factors” included in \\nPart I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of additional risks.\\nKey Factors Affecting our Performance\\nWe believe that the growth and future success of our business depends on many factors, including those described \\nbelow. While each of these factors presents significant opportunities for our business, they also pose important challenges that \\nwe must successfully address in order to sustain our growth and improve our results of operations. \\nIncreasing adoption of Elastic Cloud.    Elastic Cloud, our family of cloud-based offerings, is an important growth \\nopportunity for our business. Organizations are increasingly looking for hosted deployment alternatives with reduced \\nadministrative burdens. In some cases, users of our source available software that have been self-managing deployments of the \\nElastic Stack subsequently become paying subscribers of Elastic Cloud. For the years ended April 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021, \\nElastic Cloud contributed 40%, 35%, and 27% of our total revenue, respectively. We believe that offering Elastic Cloud is \\nimportant for achieving our long-term growth potential, and we expect Elastic Cloud’s contribution to our subscription revenue \\nto continue to increase over time. However, we expect that an increase in the relative contribution of Elastic Cloud to our \\nbusiness will have a modest adverse impact on our gross margin as a result of the associated third-party hosting costs.\\nGrowing the Elastic community.    Our strategy consists of providing access to source available software, on both a \\npaid and free basis, and fostering a community of users and developers. Our strategy is designed to pursue what we believe to \\nbe significant untapped potential for the use of our technology. After developers begin to use our software and start to \\nparticipate in our developer community, they become more likely to apply our technology to additional use cases and \\nevangelize our technology within their organizations. This reduces the time required for our sales force to educate potential \\nleads on our solutions. In order to capitalize on our opportunity, we intend to make further investments to keep the Elastic Stack \\naccessible and well known to software developers around the world. We intend to continue to invest in our products and \\nsupport and engage our user base and developer community through content, events, and conferences in the U.S. and \\ninternationally. Our results of operations may fluctuate as we make these investments. \\nDeveloping new features for the Elastic Stack.     The Elastic Stack is applied to various use cases by customers, \\nincluding through the solutions we offer. Our revenue is derived primarily from subscriptions of Search, Observability and \\nSecurity built into the Elastic Stack. We believe that releasing additional features of the Elastic Stack, including our solutions, \\ndrives usage of our products and ultimately drives our growth. To that end, we plan to continue to invest in building new \\nfeatures and solutions that expand the capabilities of the Elastic Stack. These investments may adversely affect our operating \\nresults prior to generating benefits, to the extent that they ultimately generate benefits at all. \\nGrowing our customer base by converting users of our software to paid subscribers.     Our financial performance \\ndepends on growing our paid customer base by converting free users of our software into paid subscribers. Our distribution \\nmodel has resulted in rapid adoption by developers around the world. We have invested, and expect to continue to invest, \\nheavily in sales and marketing efforts to convert additional free users to paid subscribers. Our investment in sales and marketing \\nis significant given our large and diverse user base. The investments are likely to occur in advance of the anticipated benefits \\nresulting from such investments, such that they may adversely affect our operating results in the near term. \\nExpanding within our current customer base.     Our future growth and profitability depend on our ability to drive \\nadditional sales to existing customers. Customers often expand the use of our software within their organizations by increasing \\nthe number of developers using our products, increasing the utilization of our products for a particular use case, and expanding \\nuse of our products to additional use cases. We focus some of our direct sales efforts on encouraging these types of expansion \\nwithin our customer base. \\n52', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

To calculate an \\nexpansion rate as of the end of a given month, we start with the annualized spend from all such customers as of twelve months \\nprior to that month end, or Prior Period Value. A customer’s annualized spend is measured as its ACV, or in the case of \\ncustomers charged on usage-based arrangements, by annualizing the usage for that month. We then calculate the annualized \\nspend from these same customers as of the given month end, or Current Period Value, which includes any growth in the value \\nof their subscriptions or usage and is net of contraction or attrition over the prior twelve months. We then divide the Current \\nPeriod Value by the Prior Period Value to arrive at an expansion rate. The Net Expansion Rate at the end of any period is the \\nweighted average of the expansion rates as of the end of each of the trailing twelve months. The Net Expansion Rate includes \\nthe dollar-weighted value of our subscriptions or usage that expand, renew, contract, or attrit. For instance, if each customer had \\na one-year subscription and renewed its subscription for the exact same amount, then the Net Expansion Rate would be 100%. \\nCustomers who reduced their annual subscription dollar value (contraction) or did not renew their annual subscription (attrition) \\nwould adversely affect the Net Expansion Rate. Our Net Expansion Rate was approximately 117% as of April 30, 2023. \\nAs large organizations expand their use of the Elastic Stack across multiple use cases, projects, divisions and users, \\nthey often begin to require centralized provisioning, management and monitoring across multiple deployments. To satisfy these \\nrequirements, our Enterprise subscription tier provides access to key orchestration and deployment management capabilities. \\nWe will continue to focus some of our direct sales efforts on driving adoption of our paid offerings.\\nComponents of Results of Operations\\nRevenue\\nSubscription.  Our revenue is primarily generated through the sale of subscriptions to software, which is either self-\\nmanaged by the user or hosted and managed by us in the cloud. Subscriptions provide the right to use paid proprietary software \\nfeatures and access to support for our paid and unpaid software. Our subscription agreements are both term-based and \\nconsumption-based, with the vast majority of Elastic Cloud subscriptions being consumption-based. \\nA portion of the revenue from self-managed subscriptions is generally recognized up front at the point in time when \\nthe license is delivered and the remainder is recognized ratably over the subscription term. Revenue from subscriptions that \\nrequire access to the cloud or that are hosted and managed by us is recognized ratably over the subscription term or on a usage \\nbasis for consumption-based arrangements; both are presented within Subscription revenue in our consolidated statements of \\noperations. \\nServices.   Services is composed of consulting services as well as public and private training. Revenue for services is \\nrecognized as these services are delivered. \\nCost of Revenue\\nSubscription.   Cost of subscription consists primarily of personnel and related costs for employees associated with \\nsupporting our subscription arrangements, certain third-party expenses, and amortization of certain intangible and other assets. \\nPersonnel and related costs, or personnel costs, comprise cash compensation, benefits and stock-based compensation to \\nemployees, costs of third-party contractors, and allocated overhead costs. Third-party expenses consist of cloud hosting costs \\nand other expenses directly associated with our customer support. We expect our cost of subscription to increase in absolute \\ndollars as our subscription revenue increases.\\nServices.   Cost of services revenue consists primarily of personnel costs directly associated with delivery of training, \\nimplementation and other services, costs of third-party contractors, facility rental charges and allocated overhead costs.

We believe that the credit quality of the securities portfolio is strong and diversified among industries and individual \\nissuers. \\nWe have generated significant operating losses from our operations as reflected in our accumulated deficit of \\n$1.1 billion as of April 30, 2023. We have historically incurred, and expect to continue to incur, operating losses and may \\ngenerate negative cash flows from operations on an annual basis for the foreseeable future due to the investments we intend to \\nmake as described above, and as a result, we may require additional capital resources to execute on our strategic initiatives to \\ngrow our business.\\nWe believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our operating \\nand capital needs for at least the next 12 months, despite the uncertainty in the changing market and macroeconomic conditions. \\nOur assessment of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a \\nforward-looking statement and involves risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could vary as a result of, and our future \\ncapital requirements, both near-term and long-term, will depend on, many factors, including our growth rate, the timing and \\nextent of spending to support our research and development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the timing \\nof new introductions of solutions or features, and the continuing market acceptance of our solutions and services. We may in \\nthe future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services and technologies, including \\nintellectual property rights. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our \\navailable capital resources sooner than we currently expect. In July 2021, we issued long-term debt of $575.0 million, and we \\nmay be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from outside \\nsources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when \\ndesired, or if we cannot expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities because we lack sufficient \\ncapital, our business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected.\\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented:\\nYear Ended April 30,\\n2023 2022 2021\\n(in thousands)\\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 35,662 $ 5,672 $ 22,545 \\nNet cash used in investing activities $ (272,952) $ (127,271) $ (1,518) \\nNet cash provided by financing activities $ 17,471 $ 602,127 $ 77,258 Provision for Income Taxes\\n61', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

For further information see Note 13, “Income \\ntaxes,” of our accompanying Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report \\non Form 10-K.\\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\\nIn preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the \\nUnited States of America (“GAAP”), we are required to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts \\nreported on our financial statements and the accompanying disclosures. Estimates and assumptions about future events and their \\neffects cannot be determined with certainty and therefore require the exercise of judgment. We base our estimates, assumptions \\nand judgments on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. \\nThese estimates may change in future periods and will be recognized in the consolidated financial statements as new events \\noccur and additional information becomes known. Actual results could differ from those estimates and any such differences \\nmay be material to our financial statements. We believe that the critical accounting policies and estimates set forth below \\ninvolve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application than our other significant accounting policies. \\nAccounting policies that have a significant impact on our results are described in Note 2 “Summary of Significant \\nAccounting Policies” to our accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this \\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K. The accounting policies discussed in this section are those that we consider to involve a greater \\ndegree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully \\nunderstanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. \\nDue to current macroeconomic developments and conditions, estimates and assumptions about future events and their \\neffects cannot be determined with certainty and therefore require increased judgment. These estimates and assumptions may \\nchange in future periods and will be recognized in the consolidated financial statements as new events occur and additional \\ninformation becomes known. To the extent our actual results differ materially from those estimates and assumptions, our future \\nfinancial statements could be affected.\\nRevenue Recognition\\nOur contracts with customers include varying terms and conditions, and identifying and evaluating the impact of these \\nterms and conditions on revenue recognition requires significant judgment. We apply judgment in determining the customer’s \\nability and intent to pay, which is based on a variety of factors, including the customer’s historical payment experience or, in \\nthe case of a new customer, credit, reputation, and financial or other information pertaining to the customer. At contract \\ninception we evaluate whether two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as a single contract and whether \\nthe combined or single contract includes more than one performance obligation. We have concluded that our contracts with \\ncustomers generally do not contain warranties that give rise to a separate performance obligation.\\nOur contracts often contain multiple performance obligations. For these contracts, we account for individual \\nperformance obligations separately if they are distinct. We apply significant judgment in identifying and accounting for each \\nperformance obligation, as a result of evaluating the terms and conditions in contracts. The transaction price is allocated to the \\nseparate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price (“SSP”) basis. We determine the SSP based on the prices \\nat which we separately sell these products assuming the majority of these fall within a pricing range. In instances where SSP is \\nnot directly observable, such as when we do not sell the software license separately, we derive the SSP using information that \\nmay include market conditions and other observable and unobservable inputs which can require significant judgment. There is \\ntypically more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by \\nquantity, term of the subscription, sales channel and other circumstances. If one of the performance obligations is outside of the \\nSSP range, we allocate the transaction price considering the midpoint of the SSP range. We also consider if there are any \\nadditional material rights inherent in a contract, and if so, we allocate a portion of the transaction price to such rights based on a \\nrelative SSP. \\n63', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

We determine whether costs should be deferred based on \\nsales compensation plans if the commissions are in fact incremental and would not have occurred absent the customer contract. \\nOur sales commissions plan incorporates different commission rates for contracts with new customers and incremental \\nsales to existing customers, and for subsequent subscription renewals. Sales commissions for renewal of a subscription contract \\nare not considered commensurate with the commissions paid for contracts with new customers and incremental sales to existing \\ncustomers given the substantive difference in commission rates in proportion to their respective contract values. Commissions \\npaid for contracts with new customers and incremental sales to existing customers are amortized over an estimated period of \\nbenefit of five years while commissions paid for renewal contracts are amortized based on the pattern of the associated revenue \\nrecognition over the related contractual renewal period for the pool of renewal contracts. We determine the period of benefit for \\ncommissions paid for contracts with new customers and incremental sales to existing customers by taking into consideration its \\ninitial estimated customer life and the technological life of its software and related significant features. Commissions paid on \\nservices are typically amortized in accordance with the associated revenue as the commissions paid on new and renewal \\nservices are commensurate with each other. Amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs is recognized in sales and \\nmarketing expense in the consolidated statements of operations. \\nAcquired Intangible Assets \\nWe apply significant judgment in determining the fair value of the intangible assets acquired, which involves the use \\nof significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates can include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from \\nacquired customers and acquired technology from a market participant perspective, costs to rebuild developed technology, \\nuseful lives and discount rates. While we use our best estimates and judgments, our estimates are inherently uncertain. \\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\\nWe have operations both within the United States and internationally, and we are exposed to interest rate risk and \\nforeign currency risk in the ordinary course of our business. \\nInterest Rate Risk \\nWe had cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities totaling $917.7 million as of April 30, 2023. \\nOur cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash are held in cash deposits and money market funds. The primary objectives of our \\ninvestment activities are the preservation of capital, the fulfillment of liquidity needs and the fiduciary control of cash and \\ninvestments. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Due to the short-term nature of these \\ninstruments, we do not believe that an immediate 10% increase or decrease in interest rates would have a material effect on the \\nfair value of our investment portfolio. Declines in interest rates, however, would reduce our future interest income.\\nIn July 2021, we issued $575.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.125% Senior Notes due 2029 in a private \\nplacement. The fair value of the Senior Notes is subject to market risk. In addition, the fair market value of the Senior Notes is \\nexposed to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of our fixed interest rate Senior Notes will increase as interest rates \\nfall and decrease as interest rates rise. The interest rate and market value changes affect the fair value of the Senior Notes, but \\ndo not impact our financial position, cash flows or results of operations due to the fixed nature of the debt obligation. \\nAdditionally, we carry the Senior Notes at face value less unamortized debt issuance cost on our balance sheet, and we present \\nthe fair value for required disclosure purposes only.\\nForeign Currency Risk \\nOur revenue and expenses are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars, and to a lesser extent the Euro, British Pound \\nSterling, and other currencies. To date, we have not had a formal hedging program with respect to foreign currency, but we may \\nadopt such a program in the future if our exposure to foreign currency should become more significant. For business conducted \\noutside of the United States, we may have both revenue and costs incurred in the local currency of the subsidiary, creating a \\npartial natural hedge.

Our responsibility is to \\nexpress opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial \\nreporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight \\nBoard (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. \\nfederal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the \\naudits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, \\nwhether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material \\nrespects.\\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement \\nof the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. \\nSuch procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated \\nfinancial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by \\nmanagement, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal \\ncontrol over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the \\nrisk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based \\non the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the \\ncircumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the \\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally \\naccepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures \\nthat (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and \\ndispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit \\npreparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and \\nexpenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the \\ncompany; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or \\ndisposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.

The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated \\nfinancial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate \\nopinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. \\nRevenue Recognition – Identification and Evaluation of Terms and Conditions in Contracts\\nAs described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, management applies the following steps in their determination \\nof revenue to be recognized: (i) identification of the contract with a customer; (ii) identification of the performance obligations \\nin the contract; (iii) determination of the transaction price; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance \\nobligations; and (v) recognition of revenue when the Company satisfies each performance obligation. The Company’s contracts \\ninclude varying terms and conditions, and identifying and evaluating the impact of these terms and conditions on revenue \\nrecognition requires significant judgment. For the fiscal year ended April 30, 2023, the Company’s revenue was $1,069.0 \\nmillion. \\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition, specifically the \\nidentification and evaluation of terms and conditions in contracts, is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by \\nmanagement in identifying and evaluating terms and conditions in contracts that impact revenue recognition. This in turn led to \\na high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and in evaluating the audit evidence to \\ndetermine whether terms and conditions in contracts were appropriately identified and evaluated by management. \\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall \\nopinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the \\nrevenue recognition process, including controls related to the identification and evaluation of terms and conditions in contracts \\nthat impact revenue recognition. These procedures also included (i) testing the completeness and accuracy of management’s \\nidentification and evaluation of the specific terms with customers by examining revenue contracts on a sample basis and (ii) \\nassessing the terms and conditions of the contract including their impact on revenue recognition.\\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\\nSan Jose, California\\nJune 16, 2023\\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2018.\\n68', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Organization and Description of Business\\nElastic N.V. (“Elastic” or the “Company”) was incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands in 2012. The Company \\ncreated the Elastic Stack, a powerful set of software products that ingest and store data from any source and in any format, and \\nperform search, analysis, and visualization on that data. Developers build on top of the Elastic Stack to apply the power of \\nsearch to their data and solve business problems. The Company offers three software solutions built into the Elastic Stack: \\nSearch, Observability, and Security. The Elastic Stack and the Company’s solutions are designed to run in public or private \\nclouds, in hybrid environments, or in multi-cloud environments.\\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\\nBasis of Presentation\\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted \\nin the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and include the financial statements of the Company and its wholly-owned \\nsubsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation.\\nFiscal Year\\nThe Company’s fiscal year ends on April 30. References to fiscal 2023, for example, refer to the fiscal year ended \\nApril 30, 2023.\\nUse of Estimates and Judgments\\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make \\nestimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities \\nat the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Such \\nestimates include, but are not limited to, allocation of revenue between recognized and deferred amounts, deferred contract \\nacquisition costs, allowance for credit losses, valuation of stock-based compensation, fair value of ordinary shares in periods \\nprior to the Company’s initial public offering, fair value of acquired intangible assets and goodwill, useful lives of acquired \\nintangible assets and property and equipment, whether an arrangement is or contains a lease, discount rate used for operating \\nleases, and valuation allowance for deferred income taxes. The Company bases these estimates on historical and anticipated \\nresults, trends and various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances, including assumptions as \\nto future events. \\nEstimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty and therefore \\nrequire the exercise of judgment. As of the date of issuance of these financial statements, the Company is not aware of any \\nspecific event or circumstance that would require the Company to update its estimates, judgments or revise the carrying value \\nof the Company’s assets or liabilities. These estimates may change, as new events occur and additional information is obtained, \\nand are recognized in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they become known. Actual results could differ from \\nthose estimates and any such differences may be material to the Company’s financial statements.\\nForeign Currency\\nThe reporting currency of the Company is the U.S. dollar. The Company determines the functional currency of each \\nsubsidiary in accordance with ASC 830, Foreign Currency Matters,  based on the currency of the primary economic \\nenvironment in which each subsidiary operates. Items included in the financial statements of such subsidiaries are measured \\nusing that functional currency. The Company periodically re-assesses its operations to determine if previous conclusions are \\nstill valid. Changes in functional currencies are applied prospectively if the operations encounter a significant and permanent \\nchange. \\nFor the subsidiaries where the U.S. dollar is the functional currency, foreign currency denominated monetary assets \\nand liabilities are re-measured into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates and foreign currency denominated nonmonetary assets \\nand liabilities are re-measured into U.S. dollars at historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign currency re-\\nmeasurement and settlements are included in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations. For the \\nyears ended April 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company recognized a re-measurement loss of $0.4 million, a loss of $3.6 \\nmillion, and a gain of $7.7 million, respectively.\\nFor subsidiaries where the functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar, the Company uses the period-end \\nexchange rates to translate assets and liabilities, the average monthly exchange rates to translate revenue and expenses, and \\nhistorical exchange rates to translate shareholders’ equity into U.S. dollars. The Company records translation gains and losses in \\naccumulated other comprehensive loss as a component of shareholders’ equity in the consolidated balance sheet.\\n75', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Accounts receivable, \\naccounts payable and accrued liabilities are stated at their carrying value, which approximates fair value due to the short time to \\nthe expected receipt or payment date.\\nConcentration of Credit Risk\\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash, cash \\nequivalents, restricted cash, marketable securities, and accounts receivable. The primary focus of the Company’s investment \\nstrategy is to preserve capital and meet liquidity requirements. The Company maintains its cash accounts with financial \\ninstitutions where, at times, deposits exceed federal insurance limits. The Company invests its excess cash in highly-rated \\nmoney market funds and in short-term investments. The Company extends credit to customers in the normal course of business. \\nThe Company performs credit analyses and monitors the financial health of its customers to reduce credit risk. Trade accounts \\nreceivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest.

No customer \\nrepresented 10% or more of net accounts receivable as of April 30, 2022. No customer accounted for more than 10% of the \\nCompany’s total revenue for the years ended April 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\\nAccounts Receivable, Unbilled Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses\\nAccounts receivable primarily consists of amounts billed currently due from customers. The Company’s accounts \\nreceivable are subject to collection risk. Gross accounts receivable are reduced for this risk by an allowance for credit losses. \\nThis allowance is for estimated losses resulting from the inability of the Company’s customers to make required payments. The \\nCompany determines the need for an allowance for credit losses based upon various factors, including past collection \\nexperience, credit quality of the customer, age of the receivable balance, and current economic conditions, as well as specific \\ncircumstances arising with individual customers. Accounts receivables are written off against the allowance when management \\ndetermines a balance is uncollectible and the Company no longer actively pursues collection of the receivable.\\nThe Company does not typically offer right of refund in its contracts. The allowance for credit losses reflects the \\nCompany’s best estimate of probable losses inherent in the Company’s receivables portfolio. As of April 30, 2023 and 2022, \\nthe allowance for credit losses was $3.4 million and $2.7 million, respectively. Activity related to the Company’s allowance for \\ncredit losses for the years ended April 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was as follows (in thousands):\\nYear Ended April 30,\\n2023 2022 2021\\nBeginning balance $ 2,700 $ 2,344 $ 1,247 \\nCumulative-effect adjustment from adoption of ASU 2016-13 — — (367) \\nBad debt expense 2,722 2,980 5,095 \\nAccounts written off (2,013) (2,624) (3,631) \\nEnding balance $ 3,409 $ 2,700 $ 2,344 \\nUnbilled accounts receivable represents amounts for which the Company has recognized revenue, pursuant to the \\nCompany’s revenue recognition policy, for fulfilled obligations, but not yet billed.

Technological feasibility is established upon the \\ncompletion of a working prototype that has been certified as having no critical bugs and is a release candidate. To date, costs to \\ndevelop software that is marketed externally have not been capitalized as the current software development process is \\nessentially completed concurrently with the establishment of technological feasibility. As such, all related software \\ndevelopment costs are expensed as incurred and included in research and development expense in the consolidated statement of \\noperations.\\n77', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Costs incurred during the \\napplication development stage of the project are capitalized. \\nThe Company also capitalizes qualifying implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service \\ncontract. These costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected life of the service contract, including consideration \\nof the reasonably certain renewal periods, and are presented in the same income statement line items as the service for the \\nrelated hosting arrangement. The Company did not capitalize any costs during the year ended April 30, 2023 and capitalized \\n$5.1 million of such costs in the year ended April 30, 2022, and these costs are recorded in other assets, non-current on the \\nconsolidated balance sheets.

Upon retirement or sale, the cost of assets disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the \\nfinancial statements and any resulting gain or loss is reflected within the consolidated statement of operations. There was no \\nmaterial gain or loss incurred as a result of retirement or sale in the periods presented. Repair and maintenance costs are \\nexpensed as incurred.\\nLeases\\nLeases arise from contractual obligations that convey the right to control the use of identified property, plant or \\nequipment for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The Company determines whether an arrangement is or contains \\na lease at inception, based on whether there is an identified asset and whether the Company controls the use of the identified \\nasset throughout the period of use. At the lease commencement date, the Company determines the lease classification between \\nfinance and operating and recognizes a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability for each lease component. A right-of-\\nuse asset represents the Company’s right to use an underlying asset and a lease liability represents the Company’s obligation to \\nmake payments during the lease term. The operating lease right-of-use asset also includes any lease payments made and \\nexcludes lease incentives. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that \\nthe Company will exercise that option. Lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over \\nthe lease term. The Company accounts for lease components and non-lease components as a single lease component. Leases \\nwith an initial term of twelve months or less are classified as short-term leases and therefore are not recognized on the \\nconsolidated balance sheets and are expensed on a straight-line basis within the consolidated statement of operations. \\nThe lease liability is initially measured as the present value of the remaining lease payments over the lease term. The \\ndiscount rate used to determine the present value is the Company’s incremental borrowing rate unless the interest rate implicit \\nin the lease is readily determinable. The Company estimates its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available \\nat lease commencement date for borrowings with a similar term. The right-of-use asset is initially measured as the present value \\nof the lease payments, adjusted for initial direct costs, prepaid lease payments to lessors and lease incentives.\\nAcquisitions\\nWhen the Company acquires a business, the Company allocates the purchase price, which is the sum of the \\nconsideration provided and may consist of cash, equity or a combination of the two, in a business combination to the \\nidentifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired business at their estimated respective fair values. The excess of the purchase \\nprice over the amount allocated to the identifiable assets and liabilities, if any, is recorded as goodwill. Determining the fair \\nvalue of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management to use significant judgment and estimates, including, but \\nnot limited to, the selection of valuation methodologies, estimates of future revenue and cash flows, costs to rebuild developed \\ntechnology, discount rates and selection of comparable companies. The Company’s estimates of fair value are based upon \\nassumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may \\ndiffer from estimates. During the measurement period, the Company may record adjustments to the assets acquired and \\nliabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent \\nadjustments are recorded to other income, net in the consolidated statement of operations.\\n78', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The Company tests goodwill for impairment at \\nleast annually, in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that this \\nasset may be impaired. For the purposes of impairment testing, the Company has determined that it has one operating segment \\nand one reporting unit. The Company’s test of goodwill impairment starts with a qualitative assessment to determine whether it \\nis necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. If qualitative factors indicate that the fair value of the reporting \\nunit is more likely than not less than its carrying amount, then a quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed. For the \\nquantitative analysis, the Company compares the fair value of its reporting unit to its carrying value. If the estimated fair value \\nexceeds book value, goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no additional steps are necessary. However, if the fair value \\nof the reporting unit is less than book value, then goodwill will be impaired by the amount that the carrying amount exceeds the \\nimplied fair value.

Such events and changes may include: significant changes in performance relative to \\nexpected operating results, significant changes in asset use, significant negative industry or economic trends, and changes in the \\nCompany’s business strategy. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future \\nundiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of long-lived \\nassets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. During the year ended April 30, 2023, the \\nCompany recorded asset impairment charges comprising impairment of operating lease right-of-use assets and the associated \\nfurniture, equipment, and leasehold improvements of $5.1 million and $1.1 million, respectively, for exited leased office spaces \\nassociated with the Company’s restructuring plan. See Note 16 for further details. The Company determined that there were no \\nevents or changes in circumstances that indicated that its long-lived assets were impaired during the years ended April 30, 2022 \\nand 2021.\\nIn addition to the recoverability assessment, the Company periodically reviews the remaining estimated useful lives of \\nproperty and equipment and amortizable intangible assets.

The Company’s contracts include varying terms and conditions, and identifying and \\nevaluating the impact of these terms and conditions on revenue recognition requires significant judgment. In determining the \\nappropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as it fulfills its obligations under each of its agreements, the Company performs \\nthe following steps: \\n(i) identification of the contract with a customer;\\nThe Company contracts with its customers through order forms, which in some cases are governed by master sales\\nagreements. The Company determines that it has a contract with a customer when the order form has been approved, each \\nparty’s rights regarding the products or services to be transferred can be identified, the payment terms for the services can be \\nidentified, the Company has determined the customer has the ability and intent to pay and the contract has commercial \\nsubstance. The Company applies judgment in determining the customer’s ability and intent to pay, which is based on a variety \\nof factors, including the customer’s historical payment experience or, in the case of a new customer, credit, reputation and \\nfinancial or other information pertaining to the customer. At contract inception the Company evaluates whether two or more \\ncontracts should be combined and accounted for as a single contract and whether the combined or single contract includes more \\nthan one performance obligation. The Company has concluded that its contracts with customers generally do not contain \\nwarranties that give rise to a separate performance obligation.\\n(ii) identification of the performance obligations in the contract;\\nPerformance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the products and services that will be\\ntransferred to the customer that are both capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the products or \\nservices either on their own or together with other resources that are readily available from third parties or from the Company, \\nand are distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the products and services is separately identifiable from \\nother promises in the contract.\\nThe Company’s self-managed subscriptions include both a license providing the right to use proprietary features in its \\nsoftware, as well as an obligation to provide support (on both open source and proprietary features) and maintenance. The \\nCompany’s SaaS products provide access to hosted software as well as support, which the Company considers to be a single \\nperformance obligation.\\nServices-related performance obligations relate to the provision of consulting and training services. These services are \\ndistinct from subscriptions and do not result in significant customization of the software.\\n(iii) determination of the transaction price;\\nThe transaction price is the total amount of consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for the\\nsubscriptions and services in a contract. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in the Company’s \\njudgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract will not occur. None of the \\nCompany’s contracts contain a significant financing component.\\n(iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and\\nIf the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to the single\\nperformance obligation. For contracts that contain multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the transaction \\nprice to each performance obligation based on a relative standalone selling price (‘SSP”). The SSP is determined based on the \\nprices at which the Company separately sells these products assuming the majority of these prices fall within a pricing range. In \\ninstances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when the Company does not sell the software license separately, the \\nCompany derives the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable and unobservable inputs \\nwhich can require significant judgment. There is typically more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the \\nstratification of those products and services by quantity, term of the subscription, sales channel and other circumstances. If one \\nof the performance obligations is outside of the SSP range, the Company allocates the transaction price considering the \\nmidpoint of the SSP range. The Company also considers if there are any additional material rights inherent in a contract and, if \\nso, the Company allocates a portion of the transaction price to such rights based on a relative SSP.\\n(v) recognition of revenue when the Company satisfies each performance obligation;\\nRevenue is recognized at the time the related performance obligation is satisfied by transferring the promised product\\nor service to the customer. Revenue for SaaS offerings that relate to a specified amount of services is recognized on a \\nconsumption basis as the customers utilize the services. Revenue from SaaS offerings that are stand-ready arrangements is \\nrecognized ratably over the contract period as the Company satisfies the performance obligation. The Company’s self-managed \\nsubscriptions include both upfront revenue recognition when the license is delivered as well as revenue recognized ratably over \\nthe contract period for support and maintenance based on the stand-ready nature of these subscription elements.\\n80', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Commissions paid for contracts with new customers and incremental \\nsales to existing customers are amortized over an estimated period of benefit of five years, while commissions paid for renewal \\ncontracts are amortized based on the pattern of the associated revenue recognition over the related contractual renewal period \\nfor the pool of renewal contracts. The Company determines the period of benefit for commissions paid for contracts with new \\ncustomers and incremental sales to existing customers by taking into consideration its initial estimated customer life and the \\ntechnological life of its software and related significant features. Commissions paid on services are typically amortized in \\naccordance with the associated revenue as the commissions paid on new and renewal services are commensurate with each \\nother. Amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs is recognized in sales and marketing expense in the consolidated \\nstatement of operations.\\nThe Company periodically reviews the carrying amount of deferred contract acquisition costs to determine whether \\nevents or changes in circumstances have occurred that could impact the period of benefit of these deferred costs.\\nCost of Revenue\\nCost of revenue consists primarily of costs related to providing subscriptions and services to the Company’s \\ncustomers, including personnel costs (salaries, bonuses and benefits, and stock-based compensation) and related expenses for \\ncustomer support and services personnel, as well as cloud infrastructure costs, third-party expenses, depreciation of fixed assets, \\namortization associated with acquired intangible assets, and allocated overhead.\\nResearch and Development\\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred and consist primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, \\nbonuses and benefits, and stock-based compensation. Research and development costs also include depreciation and allocated \\noverhead.\\nAdvertising\\nAdvertising costs are charged to operations as incurred and recorded in sales and marketing expense in the \\nconsolidated statement of operations. Advertising costs were $22.4 million, $19.7 million and $16.7 million for the years ended \\nApril 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021 respectively. \\n81', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The fair value of \\nstock options and purchase rights issued to employees under the 2022 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“2022 ESPP”) is \\nestimated on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value of RSUs is estimated on the \\ndate of the grant based on the fair value of the Company’s underlying ordinary shares. Compensation expense for stock options \\nand RSUs is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The Company recognizes forfeitures as they \\noccur.\\nDebt Issuance Costs\\nCosts incurred in connection with the issuance of debt are deferred and amortized as interest expense over the term of \\nthe related debt using the effective interest method. To the extent that the debt is outstanding, these amounts are reflected in the \\nconsolidated balance sheets as direct deductions from the carrying amount of the outstanding borrowings.\\nNet Loss per Share Attributable to Ordinary Shareholders\\nThe Company calculates basic net loss per share by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of ordinary \\nshares outstanding during the period, less shares subject to repurchase. Diluted net loss per share is computed by giving effect \\nto all potentially dilutive ordinary share equivalents outstanding for the period, including stock options, restricted stock units, \\nand ESPP shares.\\nTreasury Shares\\nOrdinary shares of the Company that are repurchased are recorded as treasury shares at cost and are included as a \\ncomponent of shareholders’ equity. As of April 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company had 35,937 treasury shares that were \\nrepurchased at an average price of $10.30 per share.\\nSegments\\nOperating segments are defined as components of an entity for which separate financial information is available and \\nthat is regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”). The Company’s Chief Executive Officer is its \\nCODM. The Company’s CODM reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for the purposes of making \\noperating decisions, allocating resources and evaluating financial performance. As such, the Company has determined that it \\noperates in one operating and one reportable segment. The Company presents financial information about its operating segment \\nand geographical areas in Note 15.\\nIncome Taxes\\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the Netherlands and numerous foreign jurisdictions. These foreign \\njurisdictions may have different statutory rates than the Netherlands. The Company records a provision for (benefit from) \\nincome taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. \\nUnder this method, the Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of \\ntemporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities, as well as for operating losses \\nand tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates that are expected to apply to \\ntaxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. The Company \\nrecords a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the net amount that it believes is more likely than not to be \\nrealized.\\nThe calculation of the Company’s tax obligations involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax \\nlaws and regulations. ASC 740, Income Taxes,  provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized \\nwhen it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals \\nor litigation processes, on the basis of the technical merits. The Company has assessed its income tax positions and recorded tax \\nbenefits for all years subject to examination, based upon the Company’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information \\navailable at each period end. For those tax positions where the Company has determined there is a greater than 50% likelihood \\nthat a tax benefit will be sustained, the Company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit that may potentially be realized \\nupon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax \\npositions where it is determined there is less than 50% likelihood that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been \\nrecognized.\\n82', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

This guidance addresses how an entity should treat, measure the effect of, and \\nrecognize the effect of a modification of the terms or conditions or an exchange of a freestanding equity-classified written call \\noption that remains equity classified after modification or exchange. The Company adopted ASU No. 2021-04 on May 1, 2022. \\nThe Company’s adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. \\nNew Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted \\nAcquisitions:  In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting \\nfor Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers , improving consistency in accounting for acquired \\nrevenue contracts with customers in a business combination by requiring that acquirers apply ASC 606 to recognize contract \\nassets and contract liabilities as if they had originated the contracts. If the acquiree prepared its financial statements in \\naccordance with U.S. GAAP, the resulting acquired contract assets and liabilities should generally be consistent with the \\nacquiree’s financial statements. The new guidance becomes effective for the Company for the fiscal year ending April 30, 2024. \\nEarly adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of the new accounting standard to have a material \\nimpact on its consolidated financial statements.\\n3.

The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value of stock options, \\nwhich requires the use of assumptions including actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, expected price \\nvolatility of the Company’s ordinary shares, the risk-free interest rate and expected dividends. \\nFair Value of Ordinary Shares:     Subsequent to the IPO on October 8, 2018, the fair value of the underlying ordinary \\nshares is determined by the closing price, on the date of the grant, of the Company’s ordinary shares, which are traded publicly \\non the New York Stock Exchange. Prior to the IPO, the fair value of ordinary shares underlying the stock awards had \\nhistorically been determined by the board of directors, with input from the Company’s management. The board of directors \\npreviously determined the fair value of the ordinary shares at the time of grant of the awards by considering a number of \\nobjective and subjective factors, including valuations of comparable companies, sales of redeemable convertible preference \\nshares, sales of ordinary shares to unrelated third parties, operating and financial performance, the lack of liquidity of the \\nCompany’s ordinary shares, and general and industry-specific economic outlook. \\nExpected Term:     The expected term represents the period that options are expected to be outstanding. For option \\ngrants that are considered to be “plain vanilla,” the Company determines the expected term using the simplified method. The \\nsimplified method deems the term to be the average of the time-to-vesting and the contractual life of the options.\\nExpected Volatility:     Since the Company has limited trading history of its ordinary shares, the expected volatility is \\nderived from the average historical stock volatilities of several unrelated public companies within the Company’s industry that \\nthe Company considers to be comparable to its own business over a period equivalent to the option’s expected term.\\nRisk-Free Interest Rate:     The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of \\ngrant for zero-coupon U.S. Treasury notes with maturities approximately equal to the option’s expected term.\\nDividend Rate:     The expected dividend is assumed to be zero as the Company has never paid dividends and has no \\ncurrent plans to do so.\\nThe Company’s expected volatility and expected term involve management’s best estimates, both of which impact the \\nfair value of the option calculated under the Black-Scholes option pricing model and, ultimately, the expense that will be \\nrecognized over the life of the option.\\n94', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

If such earnings were to be repatriated, they would be \\nexempt from taxation in the Netherlands and the amount of dividend withholding taxes from such foreign jurisdictions would \\nbe $3.1 million, due to the various income tax treaties between the Netherlands and the respective foreign jurisdictions.\\n14. Employee Benefit Plans\\nThe Company has a defined-contribution plan in the United States intended to qualify under Section 401 of the \\nInternal Revenue Code (the “401(k) Plan”). The Company has contracted with a third-party provider to act as a custodian and \\ntrustee, and to process and maintain the records of participant data. Substantially all the expenses incurred for administering the \\n401(k) Plan are paid by the Company. The 401(k) Plan covers substantially all U.S. employees who meet minimum age and \\nservice requirements and allows participants to defer a portion of their annual compensation on a pre-tax basis. The Company \\nmakes contributions to the 401(k) Plan up to 6% of the participating employee’s W-2 earnings and wages. The Company \\nrecorded $17.9 million, $15.2 million, and $11.4 million of expense related to the 401(k) Plan during the years ended April 30, \\n2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\\nThe Company also has defined-contribution plans in certain other countries for which the Company recorded \\n$9.4 million, $7.2 million, and $5.1 million of expense during the years ended April 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. \\n98', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\\nNone.\\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\\nWe maintain “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the \\nExchange Act, that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under \\nthe Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and \\nforms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that \\ninformation required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated \\nand communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to \\nallow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. \\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated \\nthe effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange \\nAct) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive \\nOfficer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of April 30, 2023, our disclosure controls and procedures were \\neffective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit \\nunder the Exchange Act (a) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC rules \\nand forms and (b) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief \\nFinancial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\\nManagement's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate “internal control over financial reporting,” \\nas defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and Rule 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our management conducted an evaluation of the \\neffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of April 30, 2023 based on the criteria established in  Internal \\nControl - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\\nBased on the results of its evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was \\neffective as of April 30, 2023. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of April 30, 2023 has been \\naudited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is \\nincluded in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation \\nrequired by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended April 30, 2023 that \\nmaterially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure \\ncontrols and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving \\ntheir objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, our management does not expect that our \\ndisclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control \\nsystem, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of \\nthe control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and \\nthe benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no \\nevaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. \\nThese inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur \\nbecause of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by \\ncollusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based \\nin part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will \\nsucceed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because \\nof changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent \\nlimitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\\n100\", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

      "1. **Revenue Source:**\n",
      "   - \"Our revenue is derived primarily from subscriptions of search, observability and security built into the elastic stack.\"\n",
      "   \n",
      "2. **Future Investments:**\n",
      "   - \"We believe that releasing additional features of the elastic stack, including our solutions, drives usage of our products and ultimately drives our growth.\"\n",
      "   - \"To that end, we plan to continue to invest in building new features and solutions that expand the capabilities of the elastic stack.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Overall Revenue and Growth:**\n",
